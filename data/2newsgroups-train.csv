"talk.politics.guns",53294,"You just can't compare this way!  All homicides must be shown, per capita, not   : just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred   : murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the   : favorite. As a ""favorite"", sure.  As lethal, not likely.

If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true. What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim. 	Source: Report on Firearms and Violence : Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you   : must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to   : be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,   : so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the   : drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful. There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi. On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control. In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted. In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so. Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report. Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often. Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63. When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver. The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable"" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings."
"talk.politics.guns",53295,"Sure, but the difference in per-capita crime rates predates the : : gun control laws: The homicide rate in England was a tenth that : : of America, back when anyone in England could buy a gun without : : any paperwork at all. : Steve Manes asks: : Colin Greenwood from Scotland Yard did a study that showed that gun : control has had no effect on crime or murder rates in the UK.

Others dispute that, like Richard Hofstadter, <America As A Gun Culture>, and Newton and Zimring's <Firearms and Violence in American Life>.  But, again, statistics between too dissimilar cultures are difficult to quantify. I don't know how anyone can state that gun control could have NO effect on homicide rates.  There were over 250 >accidental< handgun homicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.  More American children accidentally shot other children last year (15) than all the handgun homicides in Great Britain.  (Source: National Safety Council.

"talk.politics.guns",53318,"I don't think such a Canada is any more ""culturally similar"" to the United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States. Actually, they do not have ""roughly the same... urban economy"",  and extremely different ethnic composition. However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control. That is a gross distortion: ""Self-defense"" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)  So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.

"talk.politics.guns",53321,"Yes, I am pro-gun, and yes, I do disagree with this statement. Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  Radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the weapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things. (Can you say ""neutron flux""?)  Plus these things have no self- defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use (low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration (translation:  cities and population centers).

"talk.politics.guns",53322,"No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue. Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim  in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders. ""Face""? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife. Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman  without much problem. You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat"" nearly as often as they do guns.

"talk.politics.guns",53323,"I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to  consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with  fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to  be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)  That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me. Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting ""reasonable"" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would  alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting. By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to  other household accidents. 1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from  drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a  better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?) While you might call it ""emphasis"", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to  pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...) Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C. resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban  can not be easily side-stepped. Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely, you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his.

The only real problems are a ~25% reduction in energy (so a .357 magnum would ""only"" be as deadly as a 9mm) and it makes alot more smoke...

"talk.politics.guns",53357,"       The relevance is that if you've got x homicides and reduce the number of gun homicides in that group, but x doesn't decrease by a significant amount, have you made an improvement, and is that improvement worth what you've paid?

What's more, it requires substantially more training to be safe and effective than a firearm. It requires physical proximity and thus a greater threat to the victim, which is a primary problem with stun guns.  You have to actually touch your assailant.

"talk.politics.guns",53358,"But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard. As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate. I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that. There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.)

"talk.politics.guns",53364,"Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade  from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.   As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from  those who don't know what it is."
"talk.politics.guns",53365,"Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation for a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern, found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old. Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika. Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and counter-clockwise swastikas. Ob guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle.  They remember being ""relocated"" by the US Army, and don't intend to do it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for weapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better from strangers."
"talk.politics.guns",53366,"      Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what it said about self-defense with a firearm.       I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to ""weapon."" The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going  ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.       Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have changed significantly between 1986 and 1987."
"talk.politics.guns",53367,"I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control laws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987), their line made so much sense -- only people who ""need"" guns should be able to get them, and the people who ""need"" them are the police and other elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me, folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or other ""legitimate"" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they can't protect you). Every pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I simply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to lower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but explaining exactly how an ""evil"" semiautomatic weapon really works does wonders). I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective against the emotional pro-control people.

Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.

"talk.politics.guns",54117,"Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                    LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.] Dear Adrian:   I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.   There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.   First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.   Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.   Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.   Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.   Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.   Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.   Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.   Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in  designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.   Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.   Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.   Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.   Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.   Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.   And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity""  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year. The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.   Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life""  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not. As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands "

""When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction   the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the   tank belched fire into the buildings.

Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I read   the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't.    It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard   sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American   cities in the Sixties. Awesley replied:     Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to   find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main   guns. I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news. Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible. And on:   I don't   expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually   do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know   what you find. I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in? If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.

"talk.politics.guns",54130,"Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits? There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting. Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket). By ""cannot now be justified"" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important? Certainly the last point is correct.

"talk.politics.guns",54132,"Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-) Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events. Funny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-) Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes. Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all? Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time. In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?

What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with? Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke ""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem, because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

"talk.politics.guns",54138," Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially lethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].  Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to  be a proper reaction [and so does the law].    Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent  since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly."

Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers. I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.  Your presumption of ""disadvantage"" I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.

"talk.politics.guns",54154,"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 / I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife than a gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.' People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death. The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter. Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker. Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison. If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.) Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.' This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh. The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this. Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive. I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes. Rick."

Since any of these things CAN be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied  lethal force when you DIDN'T think it was necessary.  (If you thought lethal force was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?) Ouch.   If you are justified in shooting them at all, you are justified in using  the best self defense ammunition you can get your hands on.  It might actually IMPROVE the legal outcome. This is why hollow points hold up in court.  They are safer for you, safer for innocent by standers, (don't as a rule go through the perp) and actually safer for the perp.  If you are using military hard ball, you may have to  shoot him 'MANY' times, where one or two hollow points might stop him and  do the job.  As a rule, the fewer wound channels, the better the chance  for his surviving the incident. Rick"
"talk.politics.guns",54167,"You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe. Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot. The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it. The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.

"talk.politics.guns",54168,"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / vincent@cad.gatech.edu (Vincent Fox) / 10:34 am  Apr 14, 1993 / This isn't rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but I can't resist.... Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired.... I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action..... Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate.... Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round. Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though. True, but this is a training function. Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for example are quite safe to carry this way. Agreed. Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue. I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds. Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category. Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's ""The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense."" In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm. Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother. For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all! That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok too!) If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-) Rick."
"talk.politics.guns",54169,"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu /  6:26 am  Apr 14, 1993 / I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority.... You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and  one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent  assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke. 'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now,  but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.) At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might  support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm. Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.   Please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might  convince your local police departments to switch.

We pointed out that it was cultural differences, and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever something was wanted, it was smuggled in.

"talk.politics.guns",54176,"      Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.       In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.        Most states do not require the registration of cars that are not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do so for tax purposes more than anything else.        Many states do not currently require this, and most, again, only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused  is not required to have insurance.        The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are significant difference between making rules for *use on public property* and *making rules for ownership*.        The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York, Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun owners would, in theory, support these planes.  (Although the numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that intentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of the next person who comes down the pike with a ""reasonable"" suggestion they've already seen abused."

If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if    it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences    as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see    them, they are not valid in this discussion.

"talk.politics.guns",54187,"Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private property, such as a farm?

A President might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to) and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote for the ""lesser of two evils."" I don't think this is a matter of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to  create a virtual ban. In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws: According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish this. How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting, target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't their only (or even a common) use. I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different, in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong. A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal  with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course, it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social problems?  There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes. In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those where guns are less common. This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government and that of other nations.

"talk.politics.guns",54188,"       As a data point from Tennessee, a friend of mine and a police officer essentially recommends that if you can, fade away.  Even if you were perfectly justified you're likely in for a great deal of  hassle.  (A side note, carrying a gun concealed is a misdemeanor.)        It's one of those ""by State"" things, pretty much.  "
"talk.politics.guns",54189,"Not so.  Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should not have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms. By the end of the Clinton administration a lot of things will be screwed up.  Hell, we'll probably be just like England. ""Tough titty"" ?  My how eloquent you are. As for your claim, I think Clinton has a big fight ahead of him if he thinks he's going to pass some comprehensive gun legislation. He will sign the Brady Bill if it gets to his desk.  We will do whatever we can to either keep that from happening, or modify it such that it is acceptable to us. Sorry, that's not possible.  And that's why we won't give them up either.  Legally or illegally, American's will keep their firearms. The number of unregistered weapons in New York City is in the millions. There aren't even close to that number of violent criminals there. If the gov't was serious about stopping violent crime they would keep violent criminals in jail for a long long time where they belong instead of letting them out on early release. Hey, we can go into politics too if we feel like it. I don't believe this one bit. Snore.  Like I take advice on the RKBA from a Brit.  No way. You watch too much ""Star Trek"".  Actually, this is an understandable attitude from a Brit; you are a subject of the state. Not necessarily.  There are ways of resisting oppression without getting caught by the gov't. The ""abstract criminal"" like the ones who killed a relative of mine while she was working in a carry-out. While undesirable, they are sometimes unavoidable.  If you don't want to resist a criminal attack by all means do nothing.  I will (a) take my chances resisting violent attack, and (b) stand a better chance of being unharmed than someone who does nothing. What a joke.  Criminals want a disarmed population.  How can you keep criminals from preying on us after our best means of self defense is taken away ?"
"talk.politics.guns",54190,"      Not provable.  It's about as ""provable"" as the number of votes vast for Bill Clinton in the last election.  If you accept the information available, you can prove one way or the other.  If you refuse to accept it, nothing is ""provable.""       Fine, support your assertation.  But, you haven't supported any assertations just yet.       The National Crime Survey, that secret Arm of the NRA, estimates between 40,000 and 50,000 with-gun self-defenses from assaults, and is considered to considerably under-report.  When broken down by weapon, there is no form of ""self-defense"" including dowing nothing which is more effective at avoiding injury or death.       Ok, support *this* assertation.  Hell, support *one*.       That's nice.       That's nice, too.        Why on Earth should we?  If you're correct we've nothing to lose by continuing to argue against it and everything to gain."
"talk.politics.guns",54191,"       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.        I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.          It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.        This is very likely.        The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.        No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.       The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.       Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.       Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.        In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists.          In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.        The situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?        The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.        You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)        45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.        You may take that for what it's worth."
"talk.politics.guns",54192,"For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical, I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in the habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with  was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence in court (""If it really was self-defence,"" the prosecuter would ask, ""why did you run away and hide from the police?"") In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut: If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of that city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible conviction for half a dozen.

"talk.politics.guns",54194,"I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...). Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And ""snipers"" too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire. I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility, government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever. Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready... And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)... Unbelievable. And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation, that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall, and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much, and could be explained by ""musta been a gas leak... "".  I think it could be done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible to cover up."

"talk.politics.guns",54197,"Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station, KTVB Channel 7. Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4. Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial. Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied. The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that, ""You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first."" Cooper acknowledged that he carried a ""9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel."" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog. When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down. Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, ""If you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.""  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  ""I'm not going to play games with either counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals."" Spence told the judge that, ""When all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.""  Spence continued, ""We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses."" Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, ""We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders."" Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was ""preposterous"" and denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting. The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility. Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that, but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, ""I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted."" Monday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled is the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton."
"talk.politics.guns",54198,"Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial. After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting. *** file follows ***  Hi Folks; As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial. Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today. More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, ""Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?""  On the evening news she said, ""I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.""  Nice sound bite (grin)! The news reporter also interviewed some guy named ""Tim"" who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. ""Tim"" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?). Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother. Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence came out, that Weaver would be aquitted. More stuff as it comes available. Drew"
"talk.politics.guns",54199,"Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025). 1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?      What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're ""in committee"".      How close is that to being made law? 2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important    differences I missed? 3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:   A. S414 doesn't specify an ""appeals"" process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established,      but not before).   B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving      using existing records (so who would I sue in ""A"" above to have an      inaccurate record corrected?)   C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an      immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.      But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a ""threat"", nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement. True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes? 4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a ""clean"" record from    buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?    At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?    'Seems at min. a ""gun counting"" scheme would be needed    (e.g., ""John Doe owns N guns"").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised    to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun    registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work. Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.

Just chuckle as the cops beat you senseless to get a confession. Just laugh yourself silly when you find that confession is valid in court.  ""Hey mate, this is justice, British style.""  Drew "
"talk.politics.guns",54211,"[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.] I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g. 1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these) This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory, do not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV."
"talk.politics.guns",54212,"Article in this morning's Houston Post....""negotiators send food to rebellious inmates as humanitarian gesture""...speaking about the Ohio prison riot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards. I know it's not the same ""group"" but the mindset appears to be common to ""those what rule"" here lately....they won't give diddley to the BD's in Waco but they treat criminals as deserving of ""humanitarian gestures"". This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more priviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abiding citizens. What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the ""leaders of the system""? Could it be that the criminal is one of the ""tools"" the ""authorities"" are using to ""excuse"" some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon the law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....don't solve the crime problem because then the citizen couldn't be held hostage to ""our help"". If the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizen/victim at the expense of the criminal none of the crap such as RICO and gun banning could be used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our every move and thought."

"talk.politics.guns",54214,"Oh Christ, here we go again. I'm actually going to assume that this was a serious posting, fool that I am. And I suppose I should just take your word for it. Did you ever think that many people who use firearms to protect themselves might not admit to it because of the ridiculous laws which exist forbidding concealed carry? I already own a cool jacket. I ride a bicycle to work and park it behind my desk. And if my woman decides to go with someone else, I'd be disappointed but killing her new suitor will probably not endear her to me any more than before. Frankly, I've never met a woman worth killing for anyway. (Now, an AR-15 with a chrome barrel, THAT's worth killing for ...!-)) Does this pinhead know something the rest of us don't? I'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns. The government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail since they don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over- burdened anyway. Where are they going to put all the millions of gun-owners who won't fork over their weapons? Maybe you'd like to volunteer the services of your humble abode, since you obviously feel sooooo strongly about this. Your argument has been rendered useless. Accept this. Find another newsgroup."

"talk.politics.guns",54216,"You can't spell. There is no question about it. We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms.

Most of my friends are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They  would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They  support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different tune.

"talk.politics.guns",54217,"Excerpts from netnews.talk.politics.guns: 18-Apr-93 2ND AMENDMENT DEAD - GOOD ! by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu  excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:      Although less apparent to those who have not researched the facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as sport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed., and  57% agreed that ""most criminals are more worried  about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.""2      One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally, a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun, the completion rate drops to 3%. 1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1991 2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1986"

"talk.politics.guns",54227,"No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings. I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite. Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin. The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero. Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at context.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of accidents and suicides that are misreported.

"talk.politics.guns",54229,"500,000 to 1,000,000 self-defense incidents a YEAR doesn't count with you? Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted  as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the ""gun owner"" column. Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The ""average threat level"" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because  they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the  ""average threat level in the country"" means to a resident there. Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors  on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left. Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane, your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything. Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.   That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches  on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if -- DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of these things EXCEPT the extinguisher. You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar, blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the power to enforce your ""rights"" but you.  Unless you've given up that  power. Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun  ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T  any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness. I think we can. HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a ""One  Million Strong!"" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they ""reached"" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a ""Two Million Strong!"" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership. In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's ""Gun Control,"" pp. 61 and 420.) As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against  hard-core gun banners. I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way. Yes, I think we can and will win this one. I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but, like you, I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.

"talk.politics.guns",54231,"Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's).  With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that ""different is good"".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain ""propriatory nature"" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun. Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot. I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time. Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off. The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).   Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.). All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver. Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there. I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)). I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training. 9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the ""Highway Patrolman"". Vincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book."

I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people an ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.          As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it would depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.

You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.

"talk.politics.guns",54261,": The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It : has been whether they fired their main guns.   Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point. At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks ""last used in Detroit in 48"". The text follows. :  You did not merely claim that : tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress : sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this.   Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say I had been told they did fire their main guns.   : You continue to : back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is : disputing. Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.   : ""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you : now going to admit that you were wrong? That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?   ""I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.""   I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, ""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.   What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post: Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song ""Black Day in July"".   Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.   : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news.    So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.   Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible. John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.  : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it.     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth. : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.    Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two. : If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.

"talk.politics.guns",54264,"	At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame war, I must disagree. 	There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.  	Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey. 	You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc.. 	Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late. 	Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling. 	As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree 100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  "
"talk.politics.guns",54265,"Anyone who worries about his own gun should not have one.  If you carry any pistol with a empty chamber and safety the chances of it going off are about zero.  Unless you sit it on top of a lite stove for a couple of minutes or put it in a fire. :-)     "
"talk.politics.guns",54266,"We all know this will never happen.  Because the Police are under the wings of Government, they will always be considered more important than Citizens. Government pens, pencils and paper are considered more important than Citizens. I think we have a problem with our Government."
"talk.politics.guns",54267,"       Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant numbers.  (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't believe you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is relevant.)        The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected. It discriminates against the poor.        Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.)        This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals contain a sort of ""gotcha"" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even if you qualify in every way.        At this point, it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke.         But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance, which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property, but in restricting activity on private property.                       This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions, where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another).         Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can be either a state or local restriciton.               The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group, here defined as ""people who own guns,"") are adversely affecting  the rights of some other group.          If for instance, ""Bob"" were using his gun to attack ""Steve,"" you'd have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group ""people who own guns"" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one.        The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.        Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. But currently we don't have that option.

"talk.politics.guns",54271,"  UPI Washington DC, Update Desk			4/15/93   For the past several months the Clinton administration has been   stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most   leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the    economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area   of jobs creation.   The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,   in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed   a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting   economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.   Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.   ""It's the guns"" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other   ""gun-nuts"" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the   economy out of the recession.  ""Their buying them five times faster than   ever before, and stockpiling left and right"", the Vice President said.     However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have   been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several   declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have   not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.   ""We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people"", said   the President of Colt industries.  ""As long as Clinton is in office, we   suspect it will"", he added.   In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new   Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's    called the ""Ban-One-A-Month"" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,   every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index    cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw   one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any   further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the   politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.   The President said, ""This law will benefit America two ways.  When the   Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run   out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,   over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the   street.""  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee   this program, citing her ""Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject   of gun control"".   Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an   amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing   caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  ""Their stockpiling,   stockpiling, stockpiling"" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference   at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.   Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment   that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been   drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, ""First we'll   fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning"", during a press   conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate   building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow   the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require   the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,   after all of the cards have been drawn.   The head of the BATF responded by saying, ""We will have to see if this   thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those   guns"".   US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado   declared this proposed law as being ""reasonable gun control which won't   affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns"".   - end article -   For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                  Bill Vojak                                 vojak@icebucket.stortek.com 				NRA, ILA,                                 Colorado Firearms Coalition"
"talk.politics.guns",54272,"I can't speak for the organizations you cited but everywhere you look in our society and government, one can see the relentless movement toward one world government.  The fact that the media demeans such charished  values as patriotism, nationalism and protectionism are some of the clues.  The fact that we are sapping the economic strength of americans to prop up a former and possibly future enemy is just another.  The fact the words like community of nations, global village and international business are in vogue are others.  International corporations are  destroying our identy and economy and the propaganda they are playing through the media and government is over powering our ability to resist. Our porous border both people and trade are an indiciation that we have already lost a great deal of sovergnty. The bottome line is that the single most evil aspect of One World Government is that you have nowhere to run to and history has proven that would be a disaster.   Beware the LIBERAL and the conservative and the moderate.  Think for yourself"
"talk.politics.guns",54273,"So, like, what do you do during those six months to be ""active?"" My town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid.  Before you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief? Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this. Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US  is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy. Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one. Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But  they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't  fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence  to those with political connections.  Is this fair? And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets? How many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market? Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry. Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed  carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good, then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing. Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for  these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern. (""Hot-livered.""  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say ""hot-headed."") Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just ""pre-felons"" waiting to commit crimes. I don't understand this sentence. Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or flood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car. But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one. None of ours, I'm sure. Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone, either.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who  drive drunk, drive without it! However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life. I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely. The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do. I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun. I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one, too."
"talk.politics.guns",54274,"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.] Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud. Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of ""election fraud"" to hold their jobs. Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were). Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident. The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room. One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, ""Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.""  I got a little pissed, and replied, ""I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district."" At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun ""close-the-loophole"" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.) The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else. Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to ""support GOAL's position"" on ""all bills."" First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).   Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a ""loophole"" and wanted it closed. Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his ""SKS assault rifle."" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state ""as strong as"" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that. Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  ""In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!"" (Oooooo!)  ""We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.""  (Naughty, naughty!) Next up was Boston city councilman Albert ""Dapper"" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their ""last rights"" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-( Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction"

"talk.politics.guns",54277,"This, at least, has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future national system. To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.  In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them,  you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly wouldn't know they had to.) Therefore, you are required to carry the card at all times, or do without emergency medical coverage.

"talk.politics.guns",54283,"There are roughly 1200 fatal, firearms-related accidents each year. The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of ""self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters"" is probably well under 250 per year. Handguns designs have included a ""hammer block"" since around 1960 or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result, modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or  in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.)  I don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders  each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only 2.1% of the murders were killings by ""wacko""s, you would be wrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated assaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks, and  preventing them, thousands of times more significant than the accidents you are worried about.

Sec 552, which was intended to prevent ""secret lawmaking"" by administrative bodies.    These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States.    It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.    It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property.    It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law.    The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille- gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations.

It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government. The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons. The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession (automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored. As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians. Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion. Sincerely, Dennis DeConcini Chairman Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government April 7, 1993"

Try reading USCA on the Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of the Constitution.  Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!     James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of     being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost     every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to     which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers     are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of     ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government     of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military     establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are     carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments     are afraid to trust the people with arms.""     James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right     of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A     well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,     trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free     country...""     Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of     the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with     respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed     and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it     will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of     a year.""     Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing     armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the     government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be     formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large     body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in     discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their     own rights and those of their fellow-citizens."" But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they said ""people"", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to ""the Right of the Militia""?...  ;-) You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and probably females under current interpretation).  The Amendment does nor refer to ""well organized"", it says ""well regulated"".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how _well regulated_ I am.  Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that was to insure the People could form a ""well regulated Militia"", not a ""well organized militia"". What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can set h_bar = C = 1... Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist Papers?!      James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General     Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first     to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a     recital of particulars."" But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He only wrote it. That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist Papers.  Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says ""well organized militia"".  That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any* weapon currently in use in the armed forces. But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.     Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This     country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit     it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,     they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or     their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.""     Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate     over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August     1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the     establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...     Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of     the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order     to raise an army upon their ruins."" So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy our Liberties and Rights."
"talk.politics.guns",54291,"	Down to 170-some odd lines.  We must be making progress! On an ironic note, where I deleted lines Emacs continually gave me the message ""Garbage collecting... Done.""  Think it's trying to tell me something? 	You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought? 	I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it. 	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk. 	That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness. 	I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated. 	This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers. 	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units. 	We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment. 	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else. 	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units. 	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions. < Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > <  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

"talk.politics.guns",54292,"	That's OK -- you can mail me if you want more discussion. 	Around here, long-guns are proof of age and fill out the forms. For pistols, nation-wide check for felonies and three days wait.  The ""good reason"" is the difference, and one Americans tend to get annoyed over as we see no reason the guy with the badge is any better than us. 	Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck with no permit, no license, and at age 12 if I'm engaged in farming work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this. Again, personal rights versus collective security. 	Strange that the rates would decline, since killing somebody is much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun. 	Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost ""in a crowd of one"" than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of the word ""intimidation"" and you can see where intimidation is not the preferable method for the normal citizen. 	Aggressive towards whom?  Southerners?  Germans?  Precisely why I think your society is less violent, weapons aside. 	Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note that our own state governments often play with game with the federal government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us. 	It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them. 	We don't.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really is in this country.  It is easier than in yours, but theft is far easier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here. 	They are neither.  They are an option.  We would never force you to own guns if you lived here.  We would, however, fight to keep that option open to you. 	Then you show you are a responsible, rational user of weapons. Welcome to our ranks.  Now, how do we teach the young people this sort of responsibility?  Cultures seem to have a grave impact here. 	I notice you didn't use my great-grandfather's name.  Well, he didn't like it much either ;-) < Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > <  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

"talk.politics.guns",54294,"Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of ""nuts"". This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as ""nuts"" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk  voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.   Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the  official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.    So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter. Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).  The above opinions are mine and mine only. I'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.  If you must flame then flame away, but a well constructed argument will be much more respected.

"talk.politics.guns",54306,"A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case: 1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously. 2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could! 3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary. 4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the ""He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!""    flag.  Sigh. 5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions."
"talk.politics.guns",54309,"...the question is: for how long? Even if the FBI had done nothing, I guess the  BDs would have committed suicide, but maybe not until hunger and thirst gave them the choice between sucide or surrender.  The BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action. They HAD the chance to surrender and get a fair trial. No matter who started the fire, the BDs were  responsible for 80+ peole dying. No one else."
"talk.politics.guns",54312,"""Put not your trust in princes"" is the Biblical proverb.  The modern analog is governments.  At the time of the founding of the US, the idea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not that common, but was explicit in the writings of the founders.  To a considerable extent, Englishmen also had those rights. Yes, times change, and technology changes.  The possibility of  a few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until quite recently.  In the feudal system, the lord was almost as restricted as the serfs, so having the people enserf themselves does not make anything better; most feudal lords, and even most slaveowners, did not mistreat those under them.

Flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm  is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory, the diluted CS gas was inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start burning until around 10:00 or 11:00. Calm down kid. Vernon (Koresh's real name) said himself that he would not leave that compound alive. The inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they  may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over. There are at least eight survivors. A caller on Rush Limbaugh today suggested that the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers. That's not such a wild idea considering their weaponry and resolve.  Sheesh! Get over it.

"talk.politics.guns",54357,"Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                            WEIRD SCIENCE Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  ""political science"" is subject to more than one interpretation.   Years ago, we heard how ""scientists"" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that ""nuclear winter"" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.   What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.   We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.   But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust ""scientists"" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's ""scientists""  have agendas of their own.   Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for ""global warming"".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.   The same appears true of ""acid rain"", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.   The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   ""Ozone depletion"", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.   Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.   Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.   And what the media didn't say about recent EPA ""discoveries"" on the  effect of ""secondhand smoking"" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.   That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.   Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street "
"talk.politics.guns",54358,"I guess what I am really asking, like I did above, how does my government who is my servent, tell me the soveriegn what I can or cannot possess? It would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less ""criminal"", by definition, than the act of possessing a television set. I also would seem to me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if I harm or kill someone with the machine gun or the television set that there  would be specific penalties for doing such.  Sorry, I was close."
"talk.politics.guns",54359,"If amnesty was their concern, they should pay in cash rather than moneyorder and they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not. This way if a gun turns out to be stolen, then even if they wanted to  prosecute, they don't know who to prosecute. Since the only concern of these(HCI and the like) people seems to be the total eradication of guns( legal or illegal ), why should they bother to check for stolen property.  If they knew who the rightful owner is, then they would have to return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns."

Is there   any scenaro that justifies all that death? And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has   not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over   the edge. And that's if you buy the latest version of the ""story"" hook, line, and sinker.    I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment   to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe. Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no   witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they   had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the   building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back   the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.    Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any   other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

"talk.politics.guns",54382,"Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it.  What's going on here? Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next. I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse. IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations. They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles, obstensibly to perform ""gas insertions"" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push him over the edge. Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning) claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the ""gas insertion"" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill. Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence. The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back, abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls are. Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

"talk.politics.guns",54388,"Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station, KTVB Channel 7. Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5. Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial. Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case. The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_. The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley, who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in his dealings with Randy Weaver. Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he (Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the White cause."" The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained). The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince Weaver otherwise. The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must have also been phone taps. These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a case at all..."" according to the rules. Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife's voice on the tape. U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained. Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention. Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial.  Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue. "

What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound? What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh. Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks. It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid. Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people. If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.

"talk.politics.guns",54418,"[stuff deleted] Really?  How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd really like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college students from riding their bicycles near the university during the daytime?   Sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'. What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and pray for a police state to keep us all safe.

People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they did in Waco. After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against. Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters! We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population, we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would have ever thought it would happen here! I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov. SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine! And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the 2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here. Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries. Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a half of civilians. ""First they came for the Jews, but I did not stop them, because I was not a Jew: Then they came for the catholics, but I did not stop them because I was not a catholic!

""Nice evasive maneuver, Mr. Chekov, but they're still on our tail."" Let me ask it more plainly.  Which of the above complaints about David  Koresh's religious or sexual proclivities justified an armed raid by the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms? It's not entirely far-fetched.  Nobody outside the compound would know  EVERYBODY inside the compound.  Don't forget, the BATF admits having  agents inside the compound, in any case. I'm simply being the devil's advocate.

Ex-members describe him in ways not dissimilar  :to the way Jim Jones has been described. I don't know how accurate the documentary was; however, Koresh was never convicted of any crimes against children, nor was the BATF after him for child abuse.

But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas. Statistics, por favor? See my previous post.

"talk.politics.guns",54442,"gassed. But apparently true.  My opinion, only, of course. No, it is not.

"talk.politics.guns",54444,"I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective  self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the pro-RKBA arguments presented here. The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However, it is surprising that the ""Evil AntiGun Empire "" (Darth Vader breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare ""All legitimate gun defenses"" vs. ""All gun crimes.""  Instead,  it's always ""All legitimate gun defenses,""  which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just  criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which the victim died. Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who were deterred would have committed more crime or more serious crimes had they not been deterred."

"talk.politics.guns",54448,"Awesley wrote:   That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?     ""I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns   to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.""     I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're   paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own   eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps   people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,   ""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood. Later in the same post:      Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building   were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and   am inclined to believe an old sarge or two. Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are ""inclined"" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those claims are still ludicrous, however. Previously Awesley had written:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. Prompting me to write:   To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion   grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be   perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since   it makes your other claim seem more plausible. To which Awesley replied:   John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you   have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said   nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you   need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a   while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But that too is ludicrous. I wrote:   If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been   screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about   it.  Awesley relied:      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an   authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it   had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an   authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged   massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.   Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but   the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also   heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd   assert that I claimed they were truth. Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have.  Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying ""this has gone far enough.""  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it.  Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not.  Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I do not. I wrote:   Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.  Awesley wrote:      Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the    difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26    years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.   So it would have been an Army cover-up. Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said ""yes, I shelled Americans,"" or ""I gave the orders to fire the cannons,"" or ""I helped cover it up""? I wrote:   If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer   to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that   those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them. Awesley replied:     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe   that they did fire their guns. Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did.  Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known? Awesley concludes:      Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read   this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the   account I cited. Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last word to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with impunity--I am dropping the subject."

"talk.politics.guns",54476,"I don't know how quickly YOU can get a woodstove to heat up from a cold start, but mine takes about three hours. Mox nix.  The BD's were prepared to provide their own heat and light, and were doing so for weeks while the power was out.  That means the compound contained containers of flammable liquids or gases (that could be busted by a tank intrusion), plus ignition sources, which no one can  tell for sure were all off at the time. On the contrary.  We are proposing alternate scenarios.

"talk.politics.guns",54477,"A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:   Question #1 According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is 'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a  ""concealed and dangerous weapon.""  There is no statutory provision for obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.' *  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use. Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also, is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed, period?  Question #2 As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns. Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending  trial for the shooting? Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available,  either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).

"talk.politics.guns",54482,"I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after ""months of investigation"" for their raid.  I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused of stockpiling a bunch of ""9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15 and M16 assault rifles"". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?) Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!"
"talk.politics.guns",54486,"Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause. What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions. 1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb. 28th raid? 2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome. 3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the ""right"" course of action? And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in general, were proper.  But I still have some reservations. One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the ""balls"" to go ahead and take full responsibility.  Seems like the waffle boy had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue."
"talk.politics.guns",54487,"First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic. Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era. This  is most refreshing. Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days. My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the State Militia. Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State, Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary but are probably similar. Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as ""all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty- two (62) years..."". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective. It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion of this ""para-constitutional"" arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing as anything but a Federal reserve force. Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other  States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized Militia. In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen.  It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim. Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia or ""train bands"" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years, and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever, ""terrible and irresistible"". These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington. These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard. The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the  Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer. When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were ""grandfathered"". At least one of these ""grandfathered"" individuals refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the Federal Courts. Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to members of a ""well organized"" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's definition of ""well organized"". In the period of peace between the French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution. Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not be so bold. Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the Constitution. Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The Constitution prohibits States from keeping ""Troops or Ships of War in time of Peace"". I have heard some insist this prevents States from maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage. Today we call any large vessel a ""ship"" but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel.  A ""ship"" is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A ""brig"" has two masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles. ""Troops"" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization. Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out.  In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia."
"talk.politics.guns",54488,"Is it? As far as I know, tear gas, especially in large concentrations, is very dangerous (even toxic) for small children.

Definitely a very silly supposition. I would if I could.  The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also  had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically  confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the  compound in 1992. I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site. A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two  story window shown on the tv coverage. I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press  in Grenada and how that set the precedent, but decided it wasn't worthy  of discussion.  If the news reporter got shot, you can bet his family  would sue the government for letting him into the danger area. The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee  a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took  to burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was  first introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior."

I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me. I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick. Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year. By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.   BTW, I thought the second ammendment was God.  :-)"

"talk.politics.guns",54499,"	Would *you* have come out if you knew the only national TV cameras were well over a mile away, and yet the agents with the guns were only a few yards away?  They had contact with a lawyer, so I am inclined to believe they had an idea of what their situation actually was.  This also leads to the conspiracy theory that the lawyer had the BATF pinned on rights violations if the BD's acted as witnesses, hence the arson.  I doubt that one too, but it is still quite clear that leaving a safe place to surrender is a rather stupid thing to do until that place is no longer safe. 	As a matter of course, given how they've allowed no other views to be heard.  I'll reserve judgement until the trial, but so far as the FBI is concerned their statements carry the same amount of weight as photons at rest. 	Ludicrous, yes.  Possible, yes.  Plausible?  Get the jury. 	That's what gets me too.  It is likely the cult members were holed up in an enforced place inside the building.  With a decent arson attempt I suspect many of them could have been trapped.  In addition, the introduction of CS gas for several hours would have rendered many of them immobile if not unconscious when their masks quit.  All the props are there, but proving what scene was played is difficult.

"talk.politics.guns",54508,"Here is a press release from the White House.  President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100    WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press: 1:36 P.M. EDT      THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.      The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.      He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.      This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.      I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.      Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.      Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.      I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.      Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.      Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --      Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --      THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.      Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --      Q  Mr. President --      THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.      Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?      THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.      I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.      I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:      Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.      Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.      Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.      And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.      So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.      The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military"
"talk.politics.guns",54509,"Here is a press release from the White House.  President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100    WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2):      Go ahead, Sarah.      Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?      THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.      Q  What federal laws --      THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.      They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.      In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.      MS. MYERS:  Last question.      Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --      Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?      THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.      What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.      Thank you.      Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?      THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.      She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.      Thank you.  (Applause.)  -30-"

If this is so, it is an example <of the people using their power of government.  If this is not <how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes. Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc. and it would fly using the logic above. When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times, there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting the hangee. What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the limitations on the government, probably because they know that the people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just shows how gullible the people have become to ""I am from the government and am here to help you sort of line"".  We have been lied to, fed half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.

"talk.politics.guns",54512,"The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.   The documentary disucussed Koresh's ""Christ"" status inside the cult,  cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader  gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let  others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is  technically child abuse or not. All true. Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the  history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown. Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair. It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)  at this point. Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.

Under the ""War on Drugs"" campaign of ""zero tolerance"" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  ""My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder""--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.

"talk.politics.guns",54564,"re: is ""John Q. Public with a gun"" protected? Miller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying the NFA '34 tax.  Snatches of the court's decision: The Second Amendment was intended to ""assure the continuation and render  possible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be  interpreted and applied with that end in view."" The militia includes ""all males physically capable of acting in concert  for the common defense."" However, regarding sawed-off shotguns, ""certainly it is not within  judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military  equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense."" ""Judicial notice"" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such evidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming that they had ruled that it wasn't. I'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short- barrelled (""sawed-off"") shotguns in war. Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American  War; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by US soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to ""tunnel rats""  in Vietnam, but, of course, ""Miller"" took place in 1939. Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of  guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument  unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class.   I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe  we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments  have been banning or trying to ban because they have ""no sporting purpose""  and ""no provate citizen would ever need these guns"" DO fall under the  protection of the Second.   So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at  some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship  training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing  this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second. Often, what makes someone unpopular is what other people say about him. How much did any of us fear or abhor the Branch Davidians six months ago? How many of us feared or abhorred Saddam Hussein five years ago?"

"talk.politics.guns",54571,"[stuff deleted] Ah, clarification by obfuscation. Actually, the words ""A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state"" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL. The final word on liberties and rights should not belong ""to the many"".

"talk.politics.guns",54573,"This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list. Hi Folks; Wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last August. The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the ""evil"" federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents ""sawed off"" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated ""good faith"" efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people were taking an ""offensive action"" against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver. The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a ""regular supplier"").  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to ""look at the body"" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper. Prosecution quote: ""Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation."" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist Defense quote: ""The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.""  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!] Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including ""Tim"" again.  ""Tim"" claimed he was a skinhead, who were ""ordinary, working class people.""  He also claimed he was for ""white pride, not white power."" Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver. In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the ""sawed off"" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!). Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence. Drew"
"talk.politics.guns",54574,"This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list. Hi Folks; Thursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial. This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution. The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution. Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites. Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, ""whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond."" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area. They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the ""fern field""] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be ""shot in the back."" As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire. At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to ""fend him off with his gun.""  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, ""Stop!  U.S. Marshal!""  Harris then ""...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.""  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, ""You son of a bitch!"" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin. On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, ""You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?""  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available]. Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper. Notes: There was no coverage of protestors. Drew"

I will NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment, the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence (military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence, murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the  public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue, the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for BATF wrongdoing.

I find it highly unlikely that the BD would be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are pumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire  seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the very high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.   Which puts us back to the FBI did it, or the BD did it, or some other screw- up occured, which is quite possible.   The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires *everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.

"talk.politics.guns",54681,"Why don't you call the City and ask? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a ""collectors FFL"" to possess (""collectible?"") handguns. Probably a fine in practical terms. It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: ""this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you."" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family. L.V.

If there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or  any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas  contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.

That you know of. While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I left two years later, there were no clues. Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is ""no big deal"" if you are the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail, waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very early. Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a hatred that goes beyond reason. Yes, the problem is the user.  Question back (since you are one of the rational ones):  If all gun crime were to stop, would you support dropping all gun controls? They did not believe, from experience, that the ""police"" (including National Guard) could/would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human being does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.

"talk.politics.guns",54702,"Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations: 1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim  translation"" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not  surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into,  urban-folklore style. 2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a  copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution  team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't  understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and  yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly: ""If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry]."" Bingo.  Exactly.   Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion.  All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  He then continues:  ""But if he acquired the original German text of the  Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so  for a very specific reason...""  But there's absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case.  In fact, as a ""senior member of the U.S.  team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether  the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red  herrings. 3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge  levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask  to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*,  wouldn't he?     Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own?     Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: ""Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  Nazi law.""  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents ""concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation"", Dodd's motivation isn't a  mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR. 4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.   Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT a ""Nazi-inspired"" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the  1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list  other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the  discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues,  ""Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..."" -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law."
"talk.politics.guns",54703,"First of all let's assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it  in to the country, that sounds great (to those that see guns as inherently evil) except then every one  of those guns would be in the hands  of someone who obviously couldn't care less about following the law, after all they  got the gun illegally, so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun.

That is, someone  intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill  themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns, the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. (Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There people jump off buildings.)        According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime is commited by ""non-strangers,"" which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean, ""Friends and family.""  That is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on the mental image that a ""Friend, family member, or child,"" equates to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives, children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by  someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun was used against a ""friend"" or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among poor urban families, and those are also the areas most ""at risk"" for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might.        Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense, since according to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed.        Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a ""friend or family member"" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in businesses.)        I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.        There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws  would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate."
"talk.politics.guns",54731,"Kratz comments above show otherwise. Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see the evidence that Kratz uses. But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover, my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line. Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way, so it can't be ""harder than revolvers"". Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically ""these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third generation.""  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are dangerous, we see that the argument fails. Why would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning. One can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone ""getting right on your ass"".  One merely has to make accurate simple statements.  Then you get ""attaboy""s by mail and publically. Accuracy is a severe burden, but most of us manage it."
"talk.politics.guns",54732,"So?  Kratz was there - does that mean that he's a gang member? Even in the most gang-infested areas, most of the residents ARE NOT gang-members. How was it obvious?  Were they not trying to hit the target?  Or, does Kratz confuse ""marksmanship"" with ""trying to simulate a post""?  If so, that excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand that that exclusion would be an error.  (It excludes a lot of legit ""gun games"" as well.) Sounds like practical pistol or maybe IPSC.  It also sounds like how a self-defense shooter might well practice.  The only things that action excludes are hunting and ""like a post"" shooting.  Kratz should get out more often."
"talk.politics.guns",54733,"Actually, they won't.  What they'll tell you is that if you add up the number of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit self-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings against strangers committed in the bedroom.  (BTW - they didn't honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense and the benefits, but they're wrong. This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it doesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to kill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him. While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of stops, it isn't equal. Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation is either lying or...."

"talk.politics.guns",54741,"       How about ""firearm related.""        Texas is unusual in this regard.  It would be nice to reduce them both, though.        As Texas doesn't appear to have an murder rate that much higher than the national average, I would expect it is a result of a much higher suicide rate.        Be nice if you didn't have to suffer at all.        Here's where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to have government regulation on something which is likely to cause others harm.  What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large group in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's appropriate.          Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which to punish an individual.         Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?         Virginia.  It passed.         Does it?         Cute analogy.          The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However, we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate *all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual. That is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.         Huh?"

"talk.politics.guns",54771,"Well the attorneys of the Davidians reported on Larry King that the tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that effectuating egress from the building was difficult at best. With a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls were nearly impossible.  I find this explanation to be completely  plausible.  Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it intrinsically less believable than the government stories. I concur. Indeed.  According to the lawyers, the Davidian survivors say that lanterns were knocked over during the ""probing"" and that's how the fire started.  A tragic accident, if true. See above.  This one is going to be thoroughly investigated.  Maybe we'll eventually get some idea of what happened.  My view is that, from beginning to end, this operation was a botch and that it is completely possible that nut cases who were otherwise law-abiding citizens were victims of a bureaucratic execution."

That's an improvement even if the economic take is unchanged.  Sure - not everyone switches, but they were killing before."
"talk.politics.guns",54782,"That's an interesting statement.  There's quite a difference between Hollywood's ""Old West"" and the real one.  Yes, there were drunks, saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while they really did care when thugs preyed on others. We haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work. Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine guns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about guns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other guns."

"talk.politics.guns",54819,"I'm not a lawyer but to the best of my understanding, the Congress has no more rights than what is enumerated in the constitution.  That is the  prime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue. Since the Congress has the authority to levy taxes, the NFA is a tax act and the registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection. U.S.C 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particular authority granted to the Congress by the Constitution.  Congress can not arbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came into effect, only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionality of law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was  never constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be unconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law being unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone convicted of breaking that law is absolved.    I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.  NFA has been invalidated in two Federal District Court cases( one may have been appellate level{ U.S. vs Rock Island Armory  and U.S. vs Dalton})."
"talk.politics.guns",54829,"jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:    Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it. Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns. Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder. I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation."

Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.

"talk.politics.guns",54898,"WHY??????????"
"talk.politics.guns",54943,"Rather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative. Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns. In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people. In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them. If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3] Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that. ""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" 	- T. Jefferson. I think what Jefferson said is still true. Not very often compared to other use.[3] This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly ""get-pissed"" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it. Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.

Some people have given me several good points to ponder and I see how I was wrong. In no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to further the anti-gun cause.  I have said several times before (but nobody seemed to be listening) that I am pro-gun and anti-gun-control. As far as the race can of worms that I have opened up I have only one thing to say - I am in no way prejudiced.

"talk.politics.guns",54952,"Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there being a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct me if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an ""off"" position or an ""on"" position because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between semi-auto and fully-auto fire? Actually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out as Richard Petty lived in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the  driveway. ;-) Well, what about what I said above?

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment? It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore"" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army. Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.  On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.

"talk.politics.mideast",75378,"G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the   Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab   absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al. First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem.

"talk.politics.mideast",75392,"Very sensible. Must you rave so? Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in  disgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am really sorry if that fact bothers you. More ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made. Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all? ""PAINFUL SEARCH .."" THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead. The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead."" Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians. Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours."" Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said. Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February. ""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot. ""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return."" There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces. THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92 HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope. ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive."" Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh. ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,"" Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother. ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We have never got any of the bodies back."" The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said. Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee. ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock."" Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

"talk.politics.mideast",75393,"1/64th or 63/64th? I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite. Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois. TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters' You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today. Source: Stanford J.

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves."" ""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically.

If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude  of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.

I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want ALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.

Clearly, occupation is an undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,  the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated  in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself. During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1] ""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Amarian.  ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities   against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the    murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian    neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish    and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

"talk.politics.mideast",75400,"Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they?                 An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated. The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded. Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.  One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan. It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR. We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade. But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands. The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent. But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes? All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins. 		THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                  KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                  OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.  Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far. They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this  time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the  plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.  Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                     MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED      Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today  of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,  a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.      The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                          Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.""      The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: ""The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this.""                          Truckloads of Bodies      Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer, Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani bodies.      ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had been burned.

So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others? Does the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and Turkey?  How about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia? Do the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?    So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.    (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph). No, I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper  would probably lead to disaster for both parties. If that's what you refer  to as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it. Oh? Have you met with them personally, to read their diaries? Fascinating. What do you _do_ for a living?    Above you wrote that you understood what i meant (underlined by ^ ):     any system can be used to solve the conflict , but not any system would     resolve it JUSTLY. An unjust solution would be a non-solution, per definition, no? You said the following: For all A it holds that A have property B. There exists an A such that property B does not hold. Thus, either or both statements must be false. I was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning. Since you claim to be logical I felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so. Am I then to assume you are  not logical? Any quote can be misused, especially when used to stereotype all  individuals by a statement of an individual. If you use the same methods that you credit 'Zionists' with, then where does that place you? Oh, by the way, I'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties'. I will and am condemning acts I find vile and inhuman, but I'll try as  long as I can not to assume those acts are by a whole people. By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel, the government of Israel,  the leaders of Israel (political and/or religious) or the jews in general? If you feel the need to condemn, condemn those responsible instead. How would you feel if we started condemning you personally based on the bombings in Egypt? "
"talk.politics.mideast",75407,"         The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17     To the children of genocide: ""Send them away into the Desert"" This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish  wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders  for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children: 	""To the Government of Aleppo. 	 November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to 	 the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum 	 [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem 	 families and received as servants when they are left alone through 	 the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect 	 all such children in your province and send them to the places of 	 deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to 	 the people. 				Minister of the Interior, 						Talaat"" [1] 	""To the Government of Aleppo. 	 September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the 	 time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their 	 lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us. 				Minister of the Interior, 						Talaat"" [2] 	""To the General Committee for settling and deportees. 	 November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the 	 orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their 	 places of exile. 	 				Abdullahad Nuri. [3] 	""To the Government of Aleppo. 	 January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been 	 opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is 	 done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt 	 of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or 	 any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it 	 purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as 	 detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received 	 into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish 	 special orphanages for them. 				Minister of the Interior, 						Talaat."" [4] 	""To the Government of Aleppo. 	 Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures 	 to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with 	 the caravans. 				Minister of the Interior, 						Talaat"" [5] 	""From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo. 	 At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows 	 of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is 	 not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by 	 Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble 	 in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned 	 out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of 	 deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent 	 away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas. 				Minister of the Interior, 						Talaat"" [6] In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and ""rationalizing"" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following: 	""I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for 	 its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks 	 it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I 	 shall die for it."" [7] These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these ""death march orders"" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians. For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society. If one were to examine the sample ""authentic text"" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.  Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey. This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian. 			- - - references - - - [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60 [2] ibid, page 60 [3] ibid, page 60 [4] ibid, page 61 [5] ibid, page 61 [6] ibid, page 62 [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387"
"talk.politics.mideast",75408,"DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]           Born 1972           Attended 9th Grade           Middle School No. 17           Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25           Microdistrict No. 3           Sumgait [Azerbaijan] Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came  home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period  in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was  the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and  other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first  cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and  on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring  that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day. When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped  by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.  The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to  the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking  passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not  taken for Armenians. We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old  building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was  packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th  Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death to the Armenians"" was written on the cars. When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call  Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.  Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to  come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you  enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was  beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,  that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people  were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very  long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,  looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said  things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that  they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that  there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of  the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later  found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed, too. When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go  home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We  started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We decided she had already left. We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . . They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians  were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we  could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He  read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the  courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,  pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They  had knives and steel truncheons. I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents  and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken  outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind  her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began  beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless. We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their  balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they  strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I  lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from  their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is  broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an  ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm. We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and  try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,  they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our  neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the  window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a  result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken  away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken  away, and everything will be OK. But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12  o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with  some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,  and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are  in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku. In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th. Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was  released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first  they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out  that they were dead. My father's older brother told me. My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My  mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the  leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator. They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely. At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out  later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called  specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address  and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the  phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He  denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father  answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he  called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of  automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had  never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20  years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he  was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure. My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was  two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural  projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and  later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from  the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in  a bookstore, and later, on a construction site. My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join  the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it. Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home  of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days. While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . . Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia, was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to  recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of  Armenia. After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that. I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I  think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due. You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had  even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move  here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and  that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct  a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies  in the hands of our government. June 13,1988 Stepanakert "
"talk.politics.mideast",75412,"Contrary to what the ""Protocols of Zion crowd"" might suggest, Judaism does not have any such goals. The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer. I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do. With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis. Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel, as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves."
"talk.politics.mideast",75414,"Sorry guys for this long article, but in fact it is mostly quotings.. well, if you just waited for 5 more lines you would have read my statement ""Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but ..."" because they belong to the human race, or do you disagree on that too ? I donot know about you, but it makes full sense to me. Israelis are being killed because Israel is occupying , Let israel withdraw and israeli blood will be saved. It isNOT the palestineans who undermined the right of life of israelis, but it is israel which occupied and exposed  the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967 ! More generally, the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada, and i had previously posted a ""long"" article about this issue, whom i finished by an open question: Suppose the Intifada stops, What is the motive for Israel to withdraw ? donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. Everybody in the world looks and hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary but not sufficient motive. As for the Arabian countries, their problems are an Arabian concern.  the Arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene. As for Serbs, I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS (excuse my language but it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself) areNOT humans. Those surely came from outer space or something. No human can allow himself to see such attrocities than to participate in. Ok. My definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics. In politics, a ""solution"" doesNOT imply ""JUST solution"". It seems that it was problem in the definition of ""solution"". I think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting. However, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but  just a solution. Hasan"
"talk.politics.mideast",75416,"But what is Hasan B. Multu's middle name?  I'm not sure, but I heard it was ""Bibo"".  I also seem to recall that ""Argic"" is Azari for ""bites the wax Macedonian"".

"talk.politics.mideast",75417,"The theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi  Armenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle.  Now, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote. What is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a one-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset, the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore, when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis defeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area. Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their country in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1] For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan:   ""They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down    by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a    building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.""  As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan: ""Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning  with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken  in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army  withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian  massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked  in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places  selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs  were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after  being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part   of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the  cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering  from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived  in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.  Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not  exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in  Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything  that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them  in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting  on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages  left behind after their occupation of this area.""[2] Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war. What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the  massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3] At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars, Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities, but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4] [1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), ""Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari     Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,"" (Istanbul, 1918).

"talk.politics.mideast",75421,"Is this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one:  Source: ""Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6""  Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.  A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.  This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.   In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

"talk.politics.mideast",75422,"The above headline is much better than the original one. read on.. So far so good... Old friend, whatever.... That is a great attitude for someone who wants to pressure the Serbs to accept a peace plan that gives them most of the territory they got by force and terror. this is a good thing to hear. Anybody wondering why Serbia is not really under any boycott? Anybody remembers the Gulf war? Did Saddam kill 100,000 people and rape 50,000 women?  Still in the threatening stage.. Maybe when there is no more Bosnians, the UN will lift the arms Embargo on them! Military intervention? that is reserved for Muslim countries. NOW HEAR THIS: real positive I might add, in favor of his old freinds of course! You bet they are not! Anybody is still convinced that this is not a religious war? A psychopath like Karadzik is considered a peacelover.. Of course he sent 100,000 muslims to permanent peace. With the blessings of Patriarch Pavle."

"talk.politics.mideast",75876,"It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it,today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It seems to be that what we lack is the will. Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event, today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

"talk.politics.mideast",75877,"You shouldn't think many Turks read Mutlu/Argic stuff. They are in my kill file, likewise any other fanatic. Well, Panos, Mr. Tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the Turks who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to believe for somebody trying to be objective. When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides. What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway? Do you think it was your right to be there? I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering. It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise. I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations better. The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals  why the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind of brainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person  treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your  history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish encounters during your schooling.  take it easy!

Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded that the delegates not go to Washington to, ""sell out the Palestinian people.""

"talk.politics.mideast",75881,"     Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Rights Violations in Azerbaijan #007                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh DEPOSITION OF KARINE (KARINA) GRIGOREVNA M. [1] Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss.""  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  ""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . . Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . . So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened. That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess. On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, ""Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare. Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?"" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on."" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out."" Mamma says, ""You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on.  We cleared the table. We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not. I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them. They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, ""Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,"" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""We'll tell them  that we live alone here."" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not. Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I  say, ""OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: ""Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"" And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first. Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, we're done here."" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside. I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember. I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  ""Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them."" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived. My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . . I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . . My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us. I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away."" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, ""Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there. When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest."" So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, ""Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life. That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  ""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and  says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?"" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them. I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward. Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night. The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut. They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We  demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""It's Seidov who sent us."" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  ""We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes. Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani."" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs. So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city. They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3. They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that. I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face. I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia. They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan. The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: ""I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before."" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                      When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man. A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment. I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?"" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, ""You'll come in this entryway over my dead body."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them. They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!""  Only they didn't shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun  literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy."" That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . . A boy said to my mother ""Where's the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  ""What's happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in. And Mamma said, ""Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything."" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" She says, ""No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, ""Come back, they're coming!"" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss. Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?"" He says, ""I don't need anything."" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, ""Where's the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him,  ""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in that direction. Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Where's the girl who was here?"" And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""She came to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, ""There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . . After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?"" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment."" So she left. That trick didn't work on them. Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ""a massive spying operation.""      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    ""None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,"" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    ""The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,"" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information ""not otherwise public"" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to ""persons and entities"" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it. UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents    SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday charging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments.    The class-action suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges the ADL and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and South Africa's apartheid policy.    The ADL refused to comment on the suit.    The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San Francicso police officer Tom Gerard, claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws.    According to the suit, Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers. Information from these files were passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges.    ""The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant,"" said former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who is representing the plaintiffs.    The ADL's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the San Francisco District Attorney's Office released documents indicating the group had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more than 30 years.    ""My understanding is that they (the ADL) consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate,"" said Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California.    ""The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American...or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite.""    The FBI and the District Attorney's Office have been investigating the operation for four months.    The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens, the son of former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens.    In a press release, the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them psychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere with their freedom of speech."

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as   I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement   between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel   revise this preliminary draft as necessary:   1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform      or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female      Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but      young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of      Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further      provocation is required.   2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant      Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans      without positive identification as military personnel, clear      indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.     a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for        Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively        military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or        self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note        that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,        AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive        military identification and require closer inspection such        as document checks.     b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,        which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less        than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals        of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a        single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,        as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.        As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to        originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify        armed response.     c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive        military identification of all personnel in the target area of        the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not        be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft        are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the        papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously        civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of        uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov        coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to        land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should        first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.        For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters        is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated        if necessary."

Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from       land links with the rest of the Jewish population.          The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,             while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were             slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.

And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII.

"talk.politics.mideast",75909,"There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program about Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects. One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include: 1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade    Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not    succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter. 2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state. 3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I     suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and    perhaps intensify. Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include: 1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical    Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This    movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily    fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this     movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return    colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of    democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian    military coup against the democratically elected Algerian    Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.    A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news    on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems. 2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia    and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil    sources from this region. 3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense    expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of    Soveit Union. The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran ."

"talk.politics.mideast",75912,"   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the    massacres there including Deir Yassen,    though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are     greatly minimized. As per request of Hasan: From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977: [pp. 225-227]     ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.     ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].     ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'     ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa."" [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world."" [2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews."

"talk.politics.mideast",75921,"I will again *repeat* my statement: 1) I *do not* condone these  *indiscriminate* Israeli acts (nor have I *ever*, 2) If the villagers do not know who these ""guerillas"" are (which you stated earlier), how do you expect the Israelis to know? It is **very** difficult to ""identify"" who they are (this *is why* the ""guerillas"" prefer to lose themselves in the general population  by dressing the same, acting the same, etc.). I agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these attacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its situation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control this ""third party state"" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept occuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do something ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never? It is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angola had the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn't) stop anti-Angolan guerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africa refused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola, would Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying that Angola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks? I refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from Lebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel.  One hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its  border but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS  CHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the  Lebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it  EASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That **change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never* have been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions.  I fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be ""used"" by EITHER side, and have been (and continue to be). But the most fundamental issue is that if a state cannot control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so, it should expect others to do it for them. Hopefully that ""other"" will be the UN but it is (as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia) weak. Tim "

"talk.politics.mideast",75927,"Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,  the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted  and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because  of race, religion and national origin? As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and  idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A  short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda  and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious  for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their  neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely  within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to  x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is  the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary  heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous,  even lunatic.  And we still demand: 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide; 4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide  and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian  political pressure.

ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.     The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.     Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and feared dead.     The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""     "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines.

"talk.politics.mideast",75928,"I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must  be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization. All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.  And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways: 1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility. 2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide. 3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests. 4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian. Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue. Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

""Armenians watch their opportunity to kill Turks and Kurds, set fire      to their villages, and then make their escape into the mountains."" Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution: 	""The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State 	governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public 	peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights; 	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental 	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution."" Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution. The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government. The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces. During the Independence War, the ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization. ""Major Principles of the Constitution"" The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:"

"talk.politics.mideast",75938," WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi  SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives. 	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say. 	""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules."" 	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria. 	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje] 	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as ""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*. 	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation"" or ""tearing up by the roots."" 	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, ""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives. 	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945. 	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26. 	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials. 	---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

"talk.politics.mideast",75941,"Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But  most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914.      'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'       (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy),            ""The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi"", p. 213.) I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians, decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping  out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive  ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and  not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We  cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to  keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because  of their religion or their race.

"talk.politics.mideast",75943,"Sooner than you expect. Remember 'Cyprus'? Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established  a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two  continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1] ""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

Source: Edward K. Boghosian, ""Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,"" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18. ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world. The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA... Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. ""The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed. Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens. More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                  SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,"" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag ""Bureau."" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle. The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not   like them!!!...because they really exist...why?  As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source   given by Serdar Argic ..   You couldn't reject it...  Here we go again..  In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give   the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!  (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)  I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.   I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..  Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)  First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)  And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book"" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)  And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198   and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215  Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is  not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?  Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!  The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn't-it?    you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?   You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..  People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still  has so many ""craps"" in the 1993.   Any question?

"talk.politics.mideast",75945,"'SDPA.ORG' criminals/Nazis in action. Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.    Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.    The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.    At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.    Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will  [FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in  [FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation.  Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and  depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh? [FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not  [FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will  [FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia.

"talk.politics.mideast",75958,"Living through those days at the age of 20 and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position.  In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey. However, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well  recognized POW camp.   I see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do you think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject  of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong. You don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN  since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short  lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the  internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it before wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions  against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after the 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say? I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had their own share too. Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks mediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there? I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International press.  He keeps saying that ""This was no longer an issue for peace talks.""  Also, you don't want me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as  a Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions  among Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish  custody. I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in late August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international  community, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?   BTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta and nobody got hurt in those events?   Like I said before.  There is even a different opinion among Greek-Cypriots for this myth.

"talk.politics.mideast",75959,"I guess, I didn't make my point clear.  In the case of Israel government, it  is not only tough talk for its intimidation policy.

"talk.politics.mideast",75961,"I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were not addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is  often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs. In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is  disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed  solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon. I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the  people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is  the Israeli way of telling us that ""if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price"".  We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young  men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING  ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real  leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a  regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that the so called ""Security Zone"" is necessary for the protection of  Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the  establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border. I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in.   If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the so-called ""Security Zone"" before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such  circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon. I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.  I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians. The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an  occupying soldier is attacked. Basil"

Huh?  The people who left, did so voluntarily.  There is no reason for Israel to let them in. 	Israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how is granting citizenship a facade? 	Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to establish what it is. 	Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel. There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500. Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.

"talk.politics.mideast",75981,"This a ""tried and true"" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the opposing ""state"" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or, in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way. Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives? Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of ""demilitarized"" or ""buffer"" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves. What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some ""guaratees""), there is no way Israel is going to accept their ""word""- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards ""anti-Israel guerillas in-residence"". Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that ""limitation"" on the troops ""powers"" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) ""guarantees"" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a ""ruse""?). Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that ""many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate."" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups. From Israel's perspective, ""concessions"" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given ""something"" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to ""take back"" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from. Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by ""private groups"", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest ""trust"" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)? Ah, ok...what is ""different"" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague ""political factors"" but about those ""tangible"" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that ""guarantee"" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of ""difference"" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing. It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened. People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades.

Now wait, there is more.   Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).   page 19:  <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>   page 21:   <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)   page 41:  <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.  Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.  There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>  page 43:   <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>  page 46:  <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>  page 46:  <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>  page 151:   <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>   page 161:   <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>> (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:   page 32:   <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect   your forces, and come to us.

"talk.politics.mideast",75986,"All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios. Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.  The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum. AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed... The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism. Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event. ""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted. When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered. In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying ""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded. We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik. There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter. After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport. All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me."" ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days. We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights. In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner. In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head. This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes. In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.

"talk.politics.mideast",75988,"They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below. Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads. The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities. Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

"talk.politics.mideast",75990,"4/15/93 1242  Turkey sends light weapons as aid to Azerbaijan By SEVA ULMAN ANKARA, Turkey (UPI) -- Turkey is arming Azerbaijan with light weapons to help it fight Armenian forces in the struggle for the Nagorno- Karabakh enclave,  the newspaper Hurriyet said Thursday. Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance. ""We are giving a positive response to all requests"" from Azerbaijan, ""within the limits of our capabilities,"" he said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework  of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition. Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan. Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. ""We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future,"" he said. He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, ""and the whole world knows about it."" Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be  based on street-level excitement, he said. There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and  helicopters. The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border.

Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.

"talk.politics.mideast",76003,"04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir By NEJLA SAMMAKIA  Associated Press Writer GUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner  of the Caucasus. The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence. Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia. They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map. A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate ""Lezghistan"" alarmed the Azerbaijani government. Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia. Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air. At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs. ""I have been drafted, but I won't go,"" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. ""Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia."" More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast. Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served. ""The police don't force people to go,"" he said. ""They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan."" All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about. Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live. Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan. ""We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,"" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval. ""We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians."" In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates. By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders. About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan. ""We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,"" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan. ""We want our own country,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us."" Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree. But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels. Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language. Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan."

To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily   reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate...""  He also stated that: ""they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian   invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and  fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least  a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population.""                 TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies. Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews? Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis."
"talk.politics.mideast",76014,"And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next. As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority. The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population. The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic. Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O-- 60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES       BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar.

"talk.politics.mideast",76016,"If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky. Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?  Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.  ""Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.""[1] [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438. As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:  ""The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.""[1] [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), ""The     Armenian Displaced Persons,"" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote. Now wait, there is more. THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead. The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead."" Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians. Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours."" Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said. Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February. ""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot. ""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return."" There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces. THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92 Serdar Argic                            'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

You killed and  raped millions people without any reason. Of course, you paid the price. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made you swim in aegean sea but not far enough. Your aggressions thru Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall not get you anywhere. **Compromise on what, the invasion of Cyprus, the involment of Turkey in **Greek politics, the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial **waters as stated by international law, the properties of the Greeks of **Konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake,sorry, Aegean. What compromise are you talking about on Cyprus. That is not Greece business to join the island to Greece. That is up to people in the island to live or not to live together. They made their decision and they are living  separetely now.There is a peace there. Greeks can't slaughter Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there. Your dream will never come true. 12 mile territorialwater!!!! Are you joking or dreaming? We can declare our 12 miles territorial water which can come close to Athens. How would you like it? If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish ships in your dream 12 mile territorial waters? We do not have any city called Konstantinople. We have a city called ISTANBUL!!!! All the greeks in Istanbul are being treated just any other Turks. There is no difference among people in Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece? Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right to have property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom of vote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places, houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them. You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen. Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915.

We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities. Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen, their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under the Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into 21th century. Therefore, do not make me laught at you. **You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks.Just **as Greeks, Arats, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had **the luck to be under Turkish occupation. **They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction. **You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about **them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.

It seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it is a part of it.   Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them within their borders?   You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal? If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in the region the better it is for them and everyone else.

If Elchibey is going to shell the  Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey  is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If  Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of  Kelbajar, his people will pay the price.  It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just  look at the situation with the Lezgians. About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there  are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there  are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this ""60  Kurd refugee"" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in  Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border  with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the ""intercepting"" of Armenian military  conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by  somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed  ""special correspondent"" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate! [h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane  [h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one [h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane [h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA. [h] No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked. [HE]	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes [HE]	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities [HE]	announced that they were going to search these cargo  [HE]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany. [HE]	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of [HE]	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not [HE]	humanitarian aid..... Your ""facts"" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey  have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments  were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with ""crap"" and dirt, then shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S. uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish  chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed  anything other than a paranoid Turkish military.  [HE]	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about. [HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons?  Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan from Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused! [HE]	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons [HE]	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan [HE]	it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons [HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons?  You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow moving air transports!"
"talk.politics.mideast",76030,"I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and Islam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say. It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise.  I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God, ""the God of Ebrahim"" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story? How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them  would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga? Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state. A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society. The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes that God will help him when he prays. Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the  religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his cut too!  Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other helps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts  that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop another religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would to come its senses, before it is too late? P.S. on the side Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones? Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran? Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there?  I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up. Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will have the same ending!!!!!!!! Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than plotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good toward each other. God help us all. Peace"

"talk.politics.mideast",76034,"Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used, the ID card specifically states on the 2nd page: EZRACHUT YISREALIT: Israeli citizen. This is true for all Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.). Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders. Probably yes. So what ? Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried ""in camera"". I wouldn't exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera. Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze, or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion. Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan). No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-) Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted. The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way. I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

"talk.politics.mideast",76036,"You somehow missed Nabil's comments, even though you included it in your followup:  I am not aware of ""killings between Jewish tribes"" in the desert. The point of ""typical thinking"" here is that while Arabs STILL TODAY act in the manner you describe, like ""any nomadic people occupying a  land"", killing and plundering each other with regularity, others have somehow progressed over time.  It is not surprising then that Arabs often accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar with: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic cleansing, land theft, torture and murder.  It is precisely this  mechanism at work that leads people to say that Jewish tribes were killing each other in the desert, even without support for such a ludicrous suggestion."
"talk.politics.mideast",76037,"I wouldn't bet on it. Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants. Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere. You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less."

"talk.politics.mideast",76040,"Some of your article was cut off on the right margin, but I will try and answer from what I can read. Judaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion. We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid (and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services)). God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere, God may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/. The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb. Only God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if that happens, it was the will of God. Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what you said.

If Israel is not willing to accept the ""word"" of others then, IMHO, it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks.  No, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect. Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible. Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh? Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years. I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the  Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were  reversed perhaps they would moderate their ""retaliation"". Brad Hernlem (hernlem@chess.ncsu.EDU)"

"talk.politics.mideast",76056,"I know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about sense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).' Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world. But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.' How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later. Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia. These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years. In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations: The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline. Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony. Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count. As for Selanik,   <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.   Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>   <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.   Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>> [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars.

This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

"talk.politics.mideast",76058,"Do you have a terminal cold? Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain  'Turkish'. Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and  a whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag,  is facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and  forced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because  of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself:  is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human  rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to  let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.         The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92         By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday         The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be          little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian          fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week.          Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the          Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of          how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25          February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the          surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in          one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were          shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I          also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift          hospital in a string of railway carriages.          Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by          Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov          Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to          his  town.   "" So where are the rest?"".  Some might have  taken          prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the          mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to          retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of          cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.          One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at          first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting          to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.          But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored          personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend          themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the          forests. In the small hours, the massacre started.          Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken          prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that          troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack          Khojaly.

Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation.

There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.""  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  ""The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,"" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. ""I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.""  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: "" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?"" wailed a mother. ""Raped. Butchered. Lost.""  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in ""crossfire"".

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS... As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills. The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...  Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire. We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts. Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  ""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission. Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary. The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have  signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians. We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed. Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot. What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and    went inside.  The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an   iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black   with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As   the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face   up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what   was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,   as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.  'Did you see any Turk officers?'  'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'  ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -   Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled  so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into   laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense  of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.  From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last   scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,   looms, even spinning-wheels.  'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must   leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.'

""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. ""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror."" ""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked. ""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not."" ""But the women and children?"" ""Will fly with the others as best they may."" p. 360. ""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'  Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.  As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.  Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.  'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.  At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-  arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."" p. 361 (fourth paragraph). ""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,   large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble   where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet   had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.  The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.   There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was   empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking   colonel.

"talk.politics.mideast",76067,"     Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #010                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh DEPOSITION OF VANYA BAGRATOVICH BAZIAN    Born 1940    Foreman    Baku Spetsmontazh Administration (UMSMR-1)    Resident at Building 36/7, Apartment 9    Block 14    Sumgait [Azerbaijan] During the first days of the events, the 27th and the 28th [of February], I was away on a business trip. On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region. After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said ""uprising"" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, ""There's unrest everywhere, be careful."" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, ""Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.""  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too. I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, ""The situation is very tense, be careful."" We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait. I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, ""Let's go find some other way to get there."" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait. He took us there. But the others had said, ""I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles."" ""Why?"" ""Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left."" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, ""In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them."" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  ""How old are you, old man?"" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. ""How old are you?"" he asks  me. I say, ""I'm 47."" ""I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'."" I say, ""It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different."" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too. We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us. I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . . Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  ""nut,"" or ""little nut,"" as ""pundukh,"" but ""fundukh"" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says ""pundukh,"" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  ""There was a car there, with five people inside it,"" he says. ""They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,"" he says, ""they wouldn't let them get out of the car."" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . . When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. ""We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here."" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, ""Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?""  But in Azerbaijani I say, ""You should be ashamed of yourself!"" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home. They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store. I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait. I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: ""Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!"" The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

"talk.politics.mideast",76068," 	Attacking? Who is attacking who? Even the country you live in,USA, have condemned 	Armenia for it's attacking. And you start to say that the attackers 	are the Azeris????? 	Azeris have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Azeris... 	Don't come with nonsence, there is no reason to attack a people 	just because a man called ""Gorbatjov and co."" gave the ""freedom"" to the people 	in this area. 	It's easy for people like you to blame history. The were a lot of          Indians living in USA. There is no reason for these  	Indians to attack the ""American"" 	people and say:""It was the fault of the government of Germany and Great  	Britain, because they made people come to our place......"" Armenians lived in 	harmony with the Azeris until ""Gorbatjov and co."" gave ""freedom"" to the people 	in Karabag, then the Armenians started to kill, rape and torture the Azeris, not only 	in Karabag but also noe in Azerbadjan.... 	  That's what i don't want, you couldn't imagine the result of a war..... 	  So France, Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan????  	  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without  	  saying it, that's no secret any more...... 	  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted. 	  Do they think that they shall move from it's neigbours when the war  	  is over???? The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must 	  	  live in harmony with these if they don't want a ""stone-age"" country, 	  for that's what's will happen Armenia if the wars continues. 	  Look, The President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, died and  Petrosyan 	  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral. Is it because 	  he liked him? Sure NOT, because Armenia needs it's neighbours and must 	  live with these. But Armenia can't stop this war with continued ordertaking 	  from states like France and USA. With other words, if you love your people 	  you must think twice..... 	  And i wonder, ""Shoot down turkish planes"" WITH WHAT????? ohhh i forgot 	  the Armenians can't find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned 	  countries.....

"talk.politics.mideast",76069,"It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested who is behind the Center for Polict Research. I will oblige. My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal. The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds. Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published  several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe. I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful. Elias Davidsson ICELAND"
"talk.politics.mideast",76070,"In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so. However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats. PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW. I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism. Elias"
"talk.politics.mideast",76073,"    April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the world are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members by the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920.       At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period, and it is important to note that those who deny that this event ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate the Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan, would like to see it happen again...

I'll  see if I can get our dear ""Mehmetcik"" to write you a letter giving you and your criminal handlers at the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle some military pointers, like how to shoot armed adult males instead of small Muslim children and pregnant women. Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992 MASSACRE UNCOVERED.... By ANATOL LIEVEN, More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing. Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees. From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines. We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure. A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions. In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers. Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS. SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD  INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY  SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

"talk.politics.mideast",76075,"Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag'  and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope. ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive."" Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh. ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,"" Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother. ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We have never got any of the bodies back."" The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said. Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee. ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock."" Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Calculating the final death toll has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 24 hours.

"talk.politics.mideast",76076,"C'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. In April  1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A  number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order  ""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the   spirit of the Nazi ideas."" He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2] [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any  official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]  A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August  1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs. [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113. Need I go on?

"talk.politics.mideast",76078,"I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held  to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living  in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination.

In his 65-page confession, Salman Demirok, a former chief of PKK operations in Hakkari confessed that high-level relations between PKK, Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed. According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only  gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with  food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory.  Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus,  used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added,  terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's  and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from  the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the  extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so  that they can travel from one region to another without being  confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed  by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to  police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus,  sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

""Abu Nidal's Advisers"" Reportedly Training                   ""PKK & ASALA Militants"" in Cyprus        Nicosia, Ankara,  Tel Aviv. The Israeli  secret service,        Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant        information in connection  with the camps set  up in the        Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of        militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for        the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated        that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military        training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.        They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for        Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing        their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the        clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist        groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations        moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they        would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a        number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos        mountains.        Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,        which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in        Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs        of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material        support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader        of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,        George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men        not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out        by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as ""extreme        racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.""  Reliable        sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent        operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that        organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in        extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established        that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his        camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking        were exposed.

"talk.politics.mideast",76080,"No, you have completely misunderstood.  I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US. You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide.

The treatment of Jews in Arab nations, an injustice of staggerring proportions, is an injustice that you do not seem to care the least bit about.  Why not?"
"talk.politics.mideast",76083,"The idea of the U.S, or any other nation, taking action, i.e., military intervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who  advocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to die. A price I am unwilling to even consider. There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust. All of the Jewish people that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of others, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw uprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned). It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles. Suppose we do this thing, what will you tell the parents, wives, children, lovers of those we are sending to die? That they gave their lives in some noble cause? Noble cause, separating some mad dogs who will turn on them. Well, I will offer you some muscle. Suppose we tell them that they have one week (this will give foreign nationals time to leave) to cease their bloodshed. At the end of that week, bring in the Tomahawk firing ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities. Perhaps when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden attack of brains. Send in missiles by all means, but do not send in troops. By all means lift the embargo. Which killers? Do you honestly believe they are all on one side? REB"
"talk.politics.mideast",76084,"If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon this.  When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:""When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?"".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his ""civilian"" status? But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG. That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel. True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines. The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be."

"talk.politics.mideast",76092,"In the South Lebanon area, only Israeli (and SLA) and Lebanese troops  are present. Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river.  Between the  Awali river and the ""Security Zone"" only Lebanese troops are stationed. That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government. I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing the problem as it stands now.  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for both sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period.  In my opinion, if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying. The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move.  I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs, that's why I post to tpm. As I explained, I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel.  I also explained why I believe that to be the case.  My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion. That is too bad. Because Israel is not occupying the ""Security Zone"" free of charge. It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.   If Lebanon were willing to agree to That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is  supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act  (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral  suicide.

"talk.politics.mideast",76094,"  Oh....I see...I didn't realize this...   I think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic, and your   reasons for thinking the way you do.

"talk.politics.mideast",76095,"I agree with Shai,  there are many references to Israeli plans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard  evidence.  I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is  still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.   The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these, then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent  reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate  (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should  agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on ""regional issues"".  The fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated. Basil"

"talk.politics.mideast",76097,"The village I described was actually the closest I could come to describing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining  inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go. But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields, but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army. Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance operation and better motivated by religious conviction.   As to retaliation, It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the  attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against  civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked. Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side. I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions, this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than  Israeli troops. I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's security, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any  further attacks on Northern Israel. Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better. I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations back in question. I agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable. Basil"

Past governments found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the requisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)?  After 26 years, Yehuda and Shomron remain barren, bereft of even  middle-sized industries, and the Jewish settlements are sterile ""bedroom communities"", havens for (in the main) Israelis (both secular *and* religious) who work in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem but cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs. There's an old saying: ""bli giboosh, ayn kivoosh"" -- just living there wasn't enough, we had to *really* settle it. But instead, we ""settled"" for Potemkin villages, and now we are paying the price (and doing for others what we should have done for ourselves)."

"talk.politics.mideast",76102,"While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated within villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms fire can not be made for field pieces. As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically ""Lebanon for the Lebanese"" motivated.  I think that the difference between them was also a matter of funding and support.  One question does come to mind however,  Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and that their stated position is: 	1.  No peace talks. 	2.  No peace talks. 	N-1. No peace talks. 	N.  No Israel if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed? Bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable than civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow to act in that manner. I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria. I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout. <*sigh*> Why can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people?"

What  was he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't  have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from  the government--why my husband was killed. On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home. He doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, ""Mamma, is  there a soccer game?"" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we  lived. I say, ""I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV."" He looked  again and said, ""Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!"" I look and see so  many people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands,  you can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, ""Down with the  Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!"" My God, why is  that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together well, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely  unexpected. And they were shouting, ""Long live Turkey!"" And they had flags, and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's  around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I  can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something, and the children behind him are shouting, ""Tear the Armenians to pieces!"" and  ""Down with the Armenians!"" They shout it again, and then shout, ""Hurrah!"" The  people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I  saw that there were women, too. I say, ""My God, there are women there too!""  And my son says, ""Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women."" Well we  didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I  simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani  neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, ""Khalida, what's going on, what  happened?"" She says, ""Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what  happened."" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,  each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their  heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I  don't know. My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, ""Oh  dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet."" And he says, ""What are  you afraid of, they're just children."" I say, ""Everything that happens comes  from children."" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and  Vocational School. ""Don't fear,"" he said, ""it's nothing, nothing all that  bad."" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.  When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and  there and I said, ""They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to  kill us."" And he says, ""Don't be afraid."" Then we heard--from the central  square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, ""You speak Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying."" He says ""Close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there."" He listened a bit and then  closed the window and went to bed, and told us, ""Come on, go to sleep, it's nothing."" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. I say, ""Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute too."" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.  Things had calmed down slightly. The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, ""Come on, Emma,  get up."" I say, ""Today's my day off, let me rest."" He says, ""Aren't you going  to make me some tea?"" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, ""Where are  you going?"" He says, ""I'm going out, I have to."" I say, ""Can you really go  outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take  the car out of the garage, go without the car."" And he says, ""Come on, close  the door!"" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it out, he probably said ""coward"" or something. I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said, ""Khalida, was it our car?"" She says, ""No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said, ""Oh, they've killed Shagen!"" Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm  standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,  they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten  o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.  I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I  don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see  it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. ""Mamma,"" he says, ""look what they're doing over there!"" They were burning everything, and there  were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing  on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are  throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony  is shouting, ""What are you standing there for, burn it!"" When they threw the  television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out  on her balcony and shouted, ""Why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their  home. Why are you burning them?"" And from the courtyard they yell at her, ""Go  inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in  your building or not?"" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,  they said, ""of them."" She says, ""No, no, no, none!"" Then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, ""Emma, Emma, you have to leave!"" I say, ""They've killed Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without  Shagen. Let them kill us, too!"" She insists, saying, ""Emma, get out of here,  go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my  daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone."" I gave her the key  and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, ""Igor, you stay  here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there."" Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and  Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in  the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,  and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, ""Madar,  Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the  garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. ""He shouts, ""Aunt  Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for  him."" I say, ""Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,  I'm coming too."" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, ""You stay  here with us, I'm go look."" He went and looked, and came back and said, ""Aunt  Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. ""Madar went off again and  then returned and said, ""Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's  there . . . wheezing."" Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, ""Don't go near him,  or we'll put you next to him."" He got scared--he's young--and came back and  said, ""I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take  Alik, maybe he'll live . . . "" They grew up together in our courtyard, they  knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and  called, and called, and called--nothing. I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, ""Two police cars drove up over  there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still  lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . ""We watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said, ""Igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work."" At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another  doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, ""Doctor, is  Shagen there?"" He says, ""What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!"" I  wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there, they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said, ""Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back."" It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say, ""Sara Baji [""Sister"" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought Shagen."" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, ""No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person."" Now Shagen  just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they  said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, ""Doctor, they've  brought Shagen in dead."" He says, ""Why are you carrying on like that, dead,  dead . . . he's alive."" But then he went all the same, and when he came back  the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, ""Doctor,  is it Shagen?"" He says, ""No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.""  I say, ""Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,  if not today, then tomorrow."" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the office. He says, ""Emma, go, go calm down a little."" Another one of our  colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous  condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes  later another colleague comes in and says, ""Oh, poor Emma!"" When she said it  like that there was no hope left.    That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured  people. At night someone took me home. I said, ""Igor, Papa's been killed."" On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:  I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is  surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. ""Hey, citizen, where  are you going?"" I say, ""I work here,"" and from inside someone shouts, ""Yes,  yes, that's our cook, let her in."" I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. He says, ""Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku."" I say, ""Doctor, how will I bury him?"" He says, ""We're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night?"" I say, ""I was at home."" He says, ""What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone?"" I say, ""No, Igor was there too."" He says, ""You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ..."" His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov. The ""ambulance"" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a  patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the  hospital until the 4th. Some police car came and they said, ""Emma, let's go."" And the women, our  colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, ""Where are  you taking her?"" I say, ""They're going to kill me, too . . . "" And the investigator says, ""Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification."" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, ""Let's  go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen."" And when I saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, ""I can't look, no."" The investigator says, ""Are there any identifying marks?"" I say, ""Let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them."" He says,  ""Isn't they're anything on his body?"" I say he has seven gold teeth and his  finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . . They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they  brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, ""Oh,  they burned him!"" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat  down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, ""Well fine, fine, since  we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . "" On the 4th they told me: ""Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now."" I cried, ""How,  how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform  his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself."" They say, ""OK,  you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they  get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible."" He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in  Sumgait. They asked me, ""Where do you want to bury him?"" I said, ""I want to  bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,"" I'm  shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, ""Do you know what  it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!"" I say, ""What do you mean,  arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone  anymore."" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He says, ""Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,  if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . "" Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.  Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,  ""Ismailov, look, is that you?"" He says, ""Yes."" ""Well look, here you're  describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?"" He says,  ""Yes."" ""And now you're telling it differently?"" He says, ""Well maybe I  forgot!"" Like that. The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a  Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were  involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports  jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, ""What's your nationality?"" He  says, ""Armenian."" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, ""If he's an Armenian, kill him, kill him!"" They started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too  . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he  had an armature shaft. He says, ""I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,  that's where I got it."" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. He said, ""I hit him twice,"" he said, "" . . . once or twice on the head with that rod."" And he said that when he started to beat him  Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,  ""I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone,"" he says, ""and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or not?"" I said, ""You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?"" He went back and looked and he was already dead. ""After that,"" that bastard Tale said, ""after that I went home."" I said, ""You . . . you . . . little snake,"" I said, ""Are you a thief and a  murderer?"" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They were taken. He says he didn't take them When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, ""How can you  have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?"" He said something, but I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, ""You still haven't straightened  everything out, I think that's unjust."" When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.  In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . . And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good  craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his  own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the  time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the  Army. And now they're fatherless... I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't know what to do with myself, I said, ""How can that be? You,"" I said, ""you are  saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'  deprivation of freedom?"" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, ""Let me at that creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . "" A relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,"" This isn't a  Soviet trial, this is unjust!"" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . . I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,  they were shouting, ""Long live Turkey!"" and ""Glory to Turkey!"" And during the  trial I said to that Ismailov, ""What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?"" I  still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet  Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still don't understand why ""Glory to Turkey!"" I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

"talk.politics.mideast",76104,"You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who can declare ""total"" victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged ""quotations"" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir Yassin ""massacre."" You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology. At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding ""quotations"" that support your preset opinions. If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your ""quotations"" have an axe to grind, and therefore you must be very careful about whom you ""quote.""  For example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar, and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy ""quotation"" that you can use to attack Israel. Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a ""scholar"" when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled. It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence, you will see his ""indictment"" to be pure hot air.  And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as ""scholarly,"" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing. The Deir Yassin ""massacre"" never took place as the propagandists tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila ""massacres."" Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for ""massacres,"" even if they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews like to do it, for reasons of their own. Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin ""massacre"" stuff with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version unless you find something serious to contradict it. Vic"

The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the  city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault.

The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire ""problem"" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his ""even-handed"" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the ""abnormal presence"" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your ""solution"" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, ""disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,"" you are engaged in a Nazi project.

"talk.politics.mideast",76115,"Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir. British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the ""Allies"" gave any green light because they liked us....) Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual ""reasoning"" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British ""water and bread"" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The ""greek empire"" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client. Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true ""Giants"" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing ""the balance of power in the Aegean"" will be used. Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem. Gr PS: I don't make any anti-...whatever rhetoric. This is the situation     in our region and needs to be said.

"talk.politics.mideast",76116,"04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES By David Ljunggren MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said. Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring. The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops. It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,"" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying. ""If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units."" Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988. The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid. A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey. Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku. ""All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,"" he said. Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself. Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front. ""The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,"" the agency said. Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders. ""The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,"" Tass quoted him as saying. At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed. ""The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country. Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects. Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned. Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.

In their names we demand justice. In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians. Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  ""rebels"". Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland. Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a ""threat"". In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe. Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population. The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide. ARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR"

This is not small. A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies a doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists, for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates, but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation, and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's rain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than  the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards in Iran."

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there? When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, ""What's going on?"" Someone tells me, ""Come listen."" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: ""Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . "" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: ""Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!"" and ""There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us."" I even heard that: ""All  Moscow is behind us."" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home. Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on. My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly. My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting ""Down with the Armenians!"" and ""Death to the Armenians!"" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age. My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, ""No, let's stay at home instead."" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater. I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. ""We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been."" Now what did they  mean by ""living like we have been?"" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan. Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say ""kill them"" over the microphone, I only heard ""beat them and  drive them out."" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage. Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family. I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there. Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had ""Ermeni oryum"" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means ""Death to  Armenians!"" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said ""Death to Armenians!"" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan. Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, ""It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up."" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window! So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place. When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: ""Let's go upstairs.""  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at ""The Corner,"" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again. We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there. In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him. That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

"talk.politics.mideast",76125,"	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday ruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that government disassociates itself from international terrorism. 	``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the Gulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility towards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said. 	The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons. 	Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.'' 	Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.'' 	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf. 	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.'' 	``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates. ""Copyright 1993 by <UPI/Newsbytes>"

"talk.politics.mideast",76133,"Los Angeles Times, Tuesday, April 13, 1993.  P. A1. NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE 	* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage 	  by a man who infiltrated political groups By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer. SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years. His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office. For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills. These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League. Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz. Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory. At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like ""Ironsides"" and ""Flipper."" On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him. The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League. Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies. Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men. Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee. Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant. The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.  However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP. The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area. In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment. Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party. Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast. To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said. ""I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,"" Bullock said.  "". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me."" Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink. ""I'm one of a kind,"" he told police. In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him. In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division. Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group: ""Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock."" From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people. In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills. Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work. Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, ""I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow."" In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law. For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy. Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office. Bullock seemed proud of his ""Operation Eavesdrop,"" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  ""For a short time, it was wonderful,"" he told police. In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a ""fact-finder"" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups. Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had ""anti-Israel leanings"" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment. Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group. Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation. Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment."

"talk.politics.mideast",76137,"How about Jews who were expelled from their homelands in Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Algeria, etc.?  Don't they deserve justice, too? Why is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel, but never against the Arab states, even when they are so much more guilty of the accusations you make?  Is it because you now call yourself a Palestinean?  This is why the ""land-for-peace"" formula is so foolish.  Land-for-land or peace-for-peace seems much more just, except that it would cost the Arabs something and so is not under consideration.   Let's not forget that about half of Israel's population are refugees from Arab countries.  Somehow, THEIR land now being occupied by Arab states and THEIR homes now being lived-in by Arab people are not included in any negotiations.  Is this your prescription for peace?  Again, you've somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab states are much more restrictive on these points.  In fact, the officially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes them resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely. There are many states in which Christians can live happily, many which have official religions and Christian majorities and Christian-based laws.  There are some 2 dozen Arab and Islamic states.  There is only 1 (one) Jewish state.  Do you have a problem with this?  Is this one Jewish state too many?  There are others who might agree with you, you know.  Have you just arrived on tpm recently???  Again, the supporters of the Arab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of ""emotional, infantile outbursts"" which have weakened their positions dramatically.  Somehow, your criticisms are very one-sided and simple-minded.  P.S. How's the Fund coming along?"
"talk.politics.mideast",76138,"The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion. In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing. Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.   The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either. This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.   Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've come to associate with Yigal Arens before.  Perhaps from now on, we should. "

The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities. 	What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away.

"talk.politics.mideast",76144,"       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS     Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday     April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate     points.     1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of     misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the     program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:     - It was alleged that:"" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological     advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of     change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. ""!     These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives      of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology     in Iran after revolution.     -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors     while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen     Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in     contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and     civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.     - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi     aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most     radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total     of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million     dead left from the war.     - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For     example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: "" It hurts me to     see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.""

Taking in account     the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its     potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the     lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries     to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones     in scientific and industrial efforts.     4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as     much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from     Iran's different sites. They say: ""We are not sure if the places visited     by IAEA are the real ones or not"" !, or "" We can not rely on IAEA's     reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear     activities before"" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build     nuclear weapons!     5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the     program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,     William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking     from the absolute knowledge!

Perhaps you would explain the testimony from members of the Irgun, to be found in their own handwriting in the Irgun Archives in Tel Aviv, that the wounded Arabs were killed, that a group of 80 prisoners was massacred, that Lehi proposed exterminating everybody at the pre-raid meeting.  Exactly what reasons can you propose that this testimony should be rejected in favour of Begin's? This is very funny.

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there  *is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in  Gaza.   Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying  entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure.  Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses (that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are  inherently in conflict. Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third  alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi"" system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens. Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities? It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan ""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish ""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither?

"talk.politics.mideast",76150,"It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it  without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible  enough to make provisions for them, but rather just leaving them to their fate.

It was legal, and good business for the sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land in a poor situation.   I don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine, and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't The way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances  beyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land, they didn't have a say.

My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.

"talk.politics.mideast",76154,"At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on. Read this: From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992 PUBLICATION BAN         The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public. By Baruch Me'iri All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: ""Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published"". The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment. In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy. In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about ""the third man"" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries. But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993. The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter: ""During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner"", asserts MK Zucker. On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, ""There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public. ""However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison."" Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  ""The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret"", wrote Zucker. The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, ""We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter"". ""The Union is aware"", says Shiffman, ""of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy. ""The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy..."" Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  ""Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it."""

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world. Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews. The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss). Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root. Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care, just being rethorical. Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead. I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly Jewish.

"talk.politics.mideast",76164,"""Assuming""? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  ""right"" or who is ""wrong"", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed ""in between"" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight. 	[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms  	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that  	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as 	""combatants"". So, what do you think is the ""meaning behind"",  	the intention and the effect when an ""army"" purposely  	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look  	like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will  	receive from this ""cover"" is more important that the harm 	that will come to civilians.* This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in ""the middle"" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians. 	But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves 	at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves ""why set  	ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made  	cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of  	view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept  	some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians. I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that ""taking the fight *to* the enemy"" will do more to stop attacks.  As I said previously, Israel spent several decades ""sitting passively"" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The ""host"" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.   This is just another ""selectively applied"" statement. The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations. That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the ""interim"" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define ""autonomy"" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will ""follow through"" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.  Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up ""tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for ""words"". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of ""guarantees"" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached. Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis ""word"" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this ""land"", what the ""other party"" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back. While the ""major armaments"" (those allowing people to wage ""civil wars"") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and ""commando"" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue. Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace. There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively ""disarmed"" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory. That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to ""take over"" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both ""sides"" need is to receive something ""tangible"". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for ""land"" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks Tim"

A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.)      My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters.      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services.      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an Israeli soldier.      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the ""isqat"" [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him.      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed.      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession.      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need.      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well.      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. In addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes.       A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for execution.      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him"

Madness. /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- ""From Israeli press. Madness."" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS. Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv. Date: 19 February 1993 Journalist: Guy Ehrlich Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories. Excerpts from the article: ""A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane"". A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness. (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...) (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something. Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say. (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly. (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts."" (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there.""

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. ""You say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?"" And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings. Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other. Dr. Juma'a Fuad Said al-Rubi. the brother from Saudi Arabia, emerges from among the ruins. Ten days ago he arrived for a family visit, mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his father and brothers. On Thursday he was handcuffed like everyone else for 12 hours, and later went with everyone to view the destrucion. He tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he is a physician, but only got a shove.  Like all the rest he also urinated in his pants, while standing with his hands bound and his eyes blindfolded for the entire day. Juma'a al-Rubi studied medicine at Cairo University, and for ten years he has been treating wealthy Saudis in Medina. His wife and four children remained there. Now his documents have been lost and he does not know how he will return to them. ""There is no humanity"", stated the physician from Saudi Arabia."

TORTURE. /* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- ""From Israeli press. TORTURE."" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS. Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz Subject: Torture Title of article: Moderate physical pressure Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated, beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife. ""At those moments"", Omar said, ""I felt that he was like a humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being"". In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. ""Among the Jews, as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people"", he said after his release, ""but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being"". Although he left the detention installation in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (""I sat at home for ten days. My hands shook from nerves""), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns. In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left it one day later - dead. ""We have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators"", noted Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...) The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment. (...follow description of tortures....) Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. ""I do not want to talk about it"", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and ashamed, he spoke: ""Sometimes he beats you and beats you until you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room, and the last interrogator says:"" Now you are kissing my hand, and later if I want, you will kiss my ass."" These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation, located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation wing. ""The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by it"", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er, governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command, was quoted in the report:  ""There is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing"".

Ha'aretz, 15 March 1993: Yehoshua Matza (Likud), Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee, stated that he intends to demand that the police department make it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills [non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.

The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents as they leave for work in Israel. They can be used to reveal the presence of knives, axes, weapons and other sharp objects. In addition to the gates, which will be operated by a private civilian company, large quantities of magnetic-card reading devices are being brought to the inspection points, to facilitate the reading of the magnetic cards these [non-Jewish] workers must carry."

Any person making such a rude and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust, or also ignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite.

"talk.politics.mideast",76176,"   As someone who reads Israeli newpapaers every day, I can state with absolute certainty, that anybody who relies on western media to get a picture of what is happening in Israel is not getting an accurate picture.

"talk.politics.mideast",76177,"   How many of you readers know anything about Jews living in the Arab countries?  How many of you know if Jews still live in these countries?  How many of you know what the circumstances of Arabic Jews leaving their homelands were?  Just curious."
"talk.politics.mideast",76178,"    Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,     and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence     in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder     and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and     came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move     like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts     of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find      your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than     anti-Israel bigotry.     It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by     residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to     WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of     innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a     racist ommission on your part.     The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is     also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have     been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave     of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the     basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing     but an anti-Israel charade.     Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli     citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials     taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your     stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan     residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as     collaborators. 	     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in     How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you     attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of     your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the     racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have        the same bigoted makeup as you?       Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master      race,' for you to avoid...     Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to     seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to     grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the     responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,     Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had     previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved     with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make     Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR     for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved     them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth     is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back     on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of     the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called     Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary     in Lebanon.       Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other     Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of     thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just     because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney     concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an     excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort     to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to     attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons     than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard     Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich      nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight      of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or     your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT     the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is     the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.     Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your     racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a     Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or     had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take     something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do     not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is     to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a      difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You     clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of      the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single     most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it     is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most     evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it     were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast     problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic     manner.     And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is     not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had     taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land     Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS     started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a      completely different set of international laws?  Since you do     continuously refer to international law, would you please say     what specific international laws Israel is violating?   						   This attitude     I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.     Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he     wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll     have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort     will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.     Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually     dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what     you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.     Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,     or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an     inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,     what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what     about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the     residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims      in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death     and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk     are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel     has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to      the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The     people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being     killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.     They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept     from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.     And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the     Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your      life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.         Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual     honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself     what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the     belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your     case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe     you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born     a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is     being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a     racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these     fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your      own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be,      it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to      appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other      people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do      some good.     But for now, you are a fruad."

"talk.politics.mideast",76182,"   Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin    or in Sabra and Shatila? If so then let me tell you some good jokes:    There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII    Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.    In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.    People die that is all. No one gets killed.    Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american    napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.    Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they     may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. No?    What do you think of this ? Isn't it stupid to say so?    Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it    intelligently.    Sincerely yours.    Hassan Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. First of all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgun and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians. The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact, a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to begin. By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing was unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops. Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not attacked with intentions of killing any civilians. To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the Holocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The village had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived. Harry."
"talk.politics.mideast",76183,"From _Myths and Facts_, by Leonard J. Davis, Near East Research Inc., 1989: [pp. 108-109]     ""Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the 100 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin on April 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance. Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs had blockaded, and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars. Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens in Jerusalem.     ""Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin, but that attack does not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to paint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about 250. In 1983, however, Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain) interviewed a survivor, Mophammed Sammour, who testified that 116 out of a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after the massacre,' Sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the five clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a list of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through the names.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure was wrong.'     ""Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians, the killing of civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated. The attackers left open an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left unharmed. After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired on the Jewish troops, some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and civilians indiscriminately. Independent observers told _The Guardian_ that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women."""

While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they    repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and    attempt to starve the Gazans. Elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in their high school by a Palestinian ""freedom fighter"" be the ones who offer their help to the Gazans. Perhaps it should be the families of the 18 Israelis who were murdered last month by Palestinian ""freedom fighters"". The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and their families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers. Groups like Hamas and the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all Jews into the sea. Perhaps, we should persuade Jewish people to help these wnderful ""freedom fighters"" attain this ultimate goal. Maybe the ""freedom fighters"" will choose to spare the co-operative Jews.

An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.

Dr. Sadik Ahmet, Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament, Visits US Washington DC, July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet, one of the two ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York. At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC, Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated six demands from Greek government. Ahmet said ""our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights. What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same as South African Apartheid."" He added: ""What we are facing is pure Greek hatred and racial discrimination."" Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece he said ""We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens and are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in the Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in the United States."" ""We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights. Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are not hired to the government offices."" ""Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career."" ""We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself a Turk."" ""We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion."" In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of Greek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example, he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki) and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes, they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including the Turkish candidates. Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947. He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the Greek military as an infantryman. In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today. A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to  condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its  sovereignty.

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the ""Turkish Minority"" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'.

Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is called ""Greek""  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with the Greek  newspaper ""Ethnos"" he said:  ""I am a Greek  citizen of Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish."" Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace. Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority, Faikoglu said.  ""In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights."" On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece. NEWSPOT, January 1993 MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE. Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.   Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.   Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  ""ENA""  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.   Bulev said in the interview: ""I am not Greek, I am Macedonian."" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that ""Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.""   The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  ""they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).""   The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.   In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.   Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.   Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.   Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith) What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants. However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice. As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind. Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion.

If you think name calling is a valid form of argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more often.

I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias. 	The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel).

"talk.politics.mideast",76228,"Sorry, I misread your remark about young men and women.  (Though I am now unsure what that sentence does mean.) You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to help the ""butchers of their choice"".  Since the primary targets of help are Muslim victims of ""ethnic cleansing"", you imply that such Muslim victims are butchers. This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans? Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not be ""ethnic cleansed"".  The Serbians want to ""ethnic cleanse"" the Muslims.  It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent. I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory. For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us? Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?"
"talk.politics.mideast",76229,"Ending an embargo does not _we_ must sell anything at all. You seem to oppose ending the embargo.  You know, it is difficult for Europeans to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place. But if this was the reason, and if furthermore both sides are equal, wouldn't all us racist Americans be favoring the good Christians (Serbs) instead of the non-Christians we really seem to favor?"
"talk.politics.mideast",76230,"Yes, victims exist.  There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts. Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government. I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks, it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide. It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold. I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was not nearly as risky. Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.   Good for business, don't you know.  And BTW, not ""everyone"" wants to help the side that is less like us. I never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one is innocent. There are just too many good reasons to stay away: 1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders    in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the    Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to    promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible    for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world. 2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.  Full    stop. 3) It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish, nor that it    would necessarily help the victims.  It is not clear what the goal is and    at what point any commitment could be ended."
"talk.politics.mideast",76231,"Right.  We'll probably end up giving them weapons. During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia. I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war. Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's about all we have to go on, isn't it?   And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levels at which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level, you do not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to empathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferring Christian over Moslem, I am an atheist myself, and I think you'll agree that in the US, the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of religion, nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.

UCS.UMASS.EDU (AFS) who wrote: [AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts? Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say! [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors. OK. [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so... There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away! [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.  I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light. [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire! Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.  [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail. My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today. [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?"

"talk.politics.mideast",76256,"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Gaza and separation from Israel Gaza and the idea of separation The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: ""You look for me !"", i.e., I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view, Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government, regardless of what it does. These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this ""government of peace"", which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the ""Rabinic"" policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it. But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation. Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): ""...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>. Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....]. ""Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...""."

"talk.politics.mideast",76259,"Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights violations. Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic. I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life. I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to it. Peace AND justice.  If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully  entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support.  Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts. Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians.  Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust. When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock.  I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution. Elias Davidsson Iceland"

On the contrary, their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them now live in rather nice, permanent houses, and own cars. There are quite a few Beduin students in the Ben-Gurion university. There are good, friendly relations between them and the rest of the population.

"talk.politics.mideast",76266,"     Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #012                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh DEPOSITION OF TATYANA MIKHAILOVNA ARUTUNIAN (NEZHINTSEVA)    Born 1932    Train Conductor    Azerbaijani Railroad    Resident at Building 13/15, Apartment 27    Microdistrict No. 3    Sumgait [Azerbaijan] I hadn't lived very long in Sumgait, only eight years. I moved there from Novosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred to Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is Arutunian, my husband's name . . . That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints  and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the  Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past  year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because  I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be  involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they  told me, ""Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for  this kind of work."" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at  the Armenians, like ""The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,"" and ""Things  will be just fine if we get rid of them all."" ""No problem, the Turks will  help,"" they say, ""if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an  hour."" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it  would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it.  Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one  even considered such an idea possible. But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative  people I would often ask, ""Where is this all leading, do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait,  there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going on?"" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that  everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of  it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I  hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were  under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade.  The women told me, ""There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade."" I didn't  believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that  they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, ""Are you the First  Secretary of our City Party Committee?"" He answers me, ""Yes."" And I ask him,  ""Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani  flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know  exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?"" And he tells me, ""Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it."" Then I asked him another question: ""And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering  us? And he said, ""I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't  anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait."" Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the  Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: ""No, we actually didn't  anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain  the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre."" Those are his  exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR. And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them,  because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors  concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't.  But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so  horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of progress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in or around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really  a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was. For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my  husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on  the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, ""You're in bed? You don't  know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they  were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars  and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they  turned the car over and burned it."" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was  returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my  neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the  middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they  were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and  I said, ""Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?"" And she said,  ""Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw  that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, ""Don't break  the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want. "" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians  although he's an Azerbaijani. While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say, ""Look, there's a crowd out  there."" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had  already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian  family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I  don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my  husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3.  There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things  were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once  wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they  beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing  the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on  television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell  us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't  have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the  Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes. At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there,  and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly  off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down  there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At  first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband,  ""Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there."" And he answered, ""I  don't know, could be."" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw  it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way,  he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging  her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell  down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their  balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of  blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two  from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself. Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman, because I had just seen that. I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, ""You kill me first, and then  let them do what they want with the corpse."" But our neighbors, it's true,  defended us, they said, ""There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away,  only Muslims live here."" Disaster missed us that time. But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately,  came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's  upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to  balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as  though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever,  and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look  and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first  time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the  morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the  Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them  too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went  toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you  could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke  Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, ""What do you want?"" And  they answered, ""We want the Armenian family that lives here"" [pointing toward  the second floor with their hands]. She says, ""I already told you, we don't  have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman  talking to you,"" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they  seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing  and left. That was the second time death was at our door. I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there,  I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we  really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth  floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight  months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to  earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture  and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas, everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything  out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on  the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that  hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means  that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to  be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been  foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of  apartments. Something on the order of ""We'll move the Armenians out and take  over their apartments."" I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I  came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the  Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I  knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in  Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was  bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were  no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw  all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did. I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they  had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some  Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with  the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on  the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure  people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for  the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But  having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having  thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people.  If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed,  and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to  calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute, ""Go and announce it on television:  Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our  neighbors from this massacre?"" Those crowds weren't such that there was no  controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms,  mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature  shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we  noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were  brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was  saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend  us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do  it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik,  what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out! The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things  I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They  were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one  o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8.  When they returned to our building I told my husband, ""Lendrush, now the  police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably  going to find out and come to our aid."" Well, alas, no, there were to be no  authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single  ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out, beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments, and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned,  it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in  Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they  attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed soldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and I can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and  from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers,  wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against  that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using  stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have  guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under  the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under  Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get  involved. If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the truth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five  years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered  me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a  Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property, or the property of some magnate, or some ""mafia"": If I want to, I'll get you  out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do  something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most  brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had  the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid, I heard with my own ears: ""Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so  instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything  will go fine for you."" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I  do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless. And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed  it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got  involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to  the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony  about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know  if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer  believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all  dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most  important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in  you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them... I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a state that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example. Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a son, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy, Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or rather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail: When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in  Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments. But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call  anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off for no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they liked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap  their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it. Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an Armenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class.  According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to his mother and said, ""Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill him? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow. . . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart."" His  mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, ""Valery, you can't go because  I am afraid."" He says, ""Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch,  just have a look."" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a  superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken  everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian  apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that  the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows  in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and  Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already  been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks  ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we  left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to  Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this  straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit  them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in  a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being  kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought  there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . . When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another,  throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if  these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end. If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of  things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped  were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying,  that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, ""What happened?"" and she  bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . .  those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that  I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it. Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided, well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny, some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . . Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who  don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when  I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are  not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they  were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a  single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan  all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack  anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are  guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it  seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; ""Did  you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31  people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an  Armenian?"" Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee. When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I  couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, ""Why  did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at  these women who are strewn about on the floor?"" The overcrowding there was  tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They  cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but  the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at  it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they  were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait,  was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored  personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart  advised him, and relocate people to the military unit. But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically,  tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the hand and said, ""Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office. I told him, ""No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of  what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the  traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . "" Oh  yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even  very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice,  expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, ""Oh, why  did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume, you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at them?"" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who  he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head  and hid it. Then I said, ""My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We  didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!"" ""Well kill me, kill me!""  Muslimzade says to me, ""But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not guilty."" And I say, ""OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give  us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and  raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things,  carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you  then?"" ""You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't  anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait."" I started  laughing and said, ""It's truly funny."" He says, ""What could I do? We didn't  know what to do."" And I say, ""I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell  you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in  front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross  over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was  during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself; either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran  away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid,  excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you,  you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done?  That's right,"" I told him, ""the City party committee got confused, all the  party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused,  they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with  impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two  days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would  have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some  Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told  them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too."" And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We  asked him, ""What? How? What will come of us?"" He openly said, ""You know, for  us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later."" The  General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all  cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because  the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke; as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When  he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit,  by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it,  because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen,  and he said, ""There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely  punished, in accordance with our laws."" And that's a quote. Then one mother  throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says, ""Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?"" They tried  to calm her down, and he said, ""In order for us to conduct a proper  investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you  must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang  who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe  someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that  you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having  lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth  about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge  later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you  can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The  names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is  necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening  gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put  the information into the urn."" Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people,  people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she  came up and said, ""You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as  will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you  please write it down for me."" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if  it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that  information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply  can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example,  should someone say that black is white if it is really black?    The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council  of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the  one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their  previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him,  and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very  politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and  when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, ""Where were you personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to  return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where  it was all leading?"" he says, ""You're telling the truth. Let's not mince  words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell  you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole  government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about  45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its  fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku."" I say, ""So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting  it?"" And he says, ""You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it  in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . "" I say, ""Fine,  you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have  known. Why did no one help us?"" And he says, ""Well, OK, we didn't know what to do"" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from  Muslimzade. Later, when he said, ""You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is  favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the  Azerbaijanis . . . "" To this l answered, ""You know what . . . I'm speaking  with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with  Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me,  please, Comrade Mamedov, "" I asked him, ""What would you say about this honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?"" Then he said, ""Yes, I  admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we  have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before  the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign  radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too."" And I say, ""There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's possible to add anything more awful."" He says, ""Yes, I agree with you, I  understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence."" I repeat that he said ""unfortunate occurrence."" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what  he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously-- and said, ""Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . "" I take this to mean that  he really thinks it's an ""unfortunate occurrence."" ""And of course,"" he says,  ""I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait,  but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being  tried."" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not,  that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody  affair. Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in Baku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an  Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, ""What, they didn't nail your husband? They screwed up."" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that anyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up to see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from  February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, ""I don't know,  Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't  put it down as unexcused absence."" I was really discouraged by this. They all  know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here  they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying  myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name is Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a  Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and  said, ""Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . "" He looked at me askance and said, ""And why are you""--he knows me by my previous last name--""why did you get wrapped up in this mess?"" I say, ""What do you mean, why did I get  wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,"" I tell him, ""I have an  Armenian last name."" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as  though he had eaten something sour, and said, ""I didn't expect that you would . . . "" What did he mean by that? And ""how"" should he behave, the chief of the pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a  reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And  if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what  can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?! He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this,  the Armenians are like that, and so on . . . By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked  him ""Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return  to Sumgait?"" he answered, ""Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't want to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I  won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years."" I say, ""So you've got another thing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then  in another 50 years it'll happen again?!"" I couldn't contain myself any more, and I also told him, ""And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew about it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in  Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received complaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did  everyone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the  way you treated them?"" And he says, ""You know, you're finally starting to  insult me!"" He threw his pen on the desk. ""Maybe now you'll say I'm a  scoundrel too?"" I say, ""You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't  know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that  comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain. ""Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors,  that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had  gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good.  ""We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of  the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of  Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in Sumgait."" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, ' ""Well, I walked down the street."" And I said, ""Walking down the street in any  city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation because I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you  spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't  know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd  hear something quite different."" I told him, for example, that I drew my  conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit; they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the  neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I  thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some anti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier  accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything  there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young  people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they  were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and  tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when  the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they  withdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of  course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .

We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, ""What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!"" I asked, ""What's going on?"" He says,  ""What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!"" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely. We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store. We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict. We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor. On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, ""We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated."" Well he says, ""Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now."" I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, ""Muslimzade here."" About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, ""Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you."" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, ""Where should I go?"" I  say, ""If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left."" That's what he did. He went down  there and said, ""The Armenians were here,"" he said, ""I let them out the back  door, they went that way."" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed. So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid. In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ... I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them. There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper. I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

"talk.politics.mideast",76286,"   Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased. But the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the mideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know nothing about.  Many of these events are not even mentioned here. I read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media for your information on Israel.  Since I read both American media and Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.    As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased, of course they are.  Some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media here in America.  But they still report events about which people here know nothing.  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy."

Otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omran would care to retract this 'error' I would be glad to retract the accusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim, I would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but ""mongrels"" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also  true that towards the end of WWII even the ""purist"" Gypsies were  hunted down as the theory was forgotten. Brendan. (email:  bdm@cs.anu.edu.au)"

"talk.politics.mideast",76299,"Pardon me Tim, but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and  whereabouts of all of them. Several villages were shelled. How could the IDF possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted villages? You see, it was an arbitrary act of ""retaliation"". The problem, Tim, is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian attacks on Israel, NOT Lebanese attacks.  First, I believe that my statement applies to both sides. Having said that, I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately negotiable and what is not. For example, no country has the right to abuse one's human rights. Deciding whether there will be one or two states in Palestine is a legitimate question. While de facto one state exists, Israel  must treat all within its domain equitably. Yes, I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify occupying your neighbor's land. Israel must resolve its disputes with the native Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks. Not true. Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the 1970s. With a strong Lebanese government (free from Syrian and Israeli interference) I believe that the border could be adequately patrolled. The Palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a threat as once existed. Please, Tim, don't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians as all part of the same group. There are too many who think all Arabs or all Muslims are the same. Too many times I have seen people support the bombing of Palestinian camps in ""retaliation"" for an IDF death at the hands of the Lebanese Resistance or the shelling of Lebanese villages in ""retaliation"" for a Palestinian attack.

"talk.politics.mideast",76302,"May I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_.  It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the ""Bible"" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement! As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views. What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same ""situation"" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the ""soc.culture.arabic"" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 ""situation"" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think? All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" and think again.  ""Freedom of choice"" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state). Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is ""null and void"" without getting assassinated himself! In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back from you soon!"

"talk.politics.mideast",76314,"Is this the joke of the month?  1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920. 2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during WWII. 3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last  four years. The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the  Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians.  For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people  lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the  oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried  out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks  and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their  homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands  were empty of Turks and Kurds.  The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye. Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia. Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated  by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity. x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide  against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations  to the Turks and Kurds. Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine  their own future as a nation in their own homeland. During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

"talk.politics.mideast",76315,"Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1] [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E.

Source: ""Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6""  Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.  A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.  This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.   In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander         of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,         Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov) ""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the  liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the  allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of  the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian  was permitted to approach the city and its environs.  While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained  in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the  area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to   attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the  plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder  of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by  the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers  who had remained in the rear during the war.  One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of  soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of  seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,  and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud  and dirt...  It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and  traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds  and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night  patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The   Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear  also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the  trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for  fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder  and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.  Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir  Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander  in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.  The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals  that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its  highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half  of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.  ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,  Odishelidge. They were as follows:  The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the  act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...  More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been  killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless   Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the  murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood   near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:  'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten  more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when  the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.  The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently  fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.  Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw  towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew  to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and  destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.  During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages  that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the   Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers  were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time  when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill  the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries  of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the   Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would  have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from  acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with  hatred and loathing.  Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that  he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The  Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the  stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since  the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed  in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen  of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping  him with the iron heel of his boot.  Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape  from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off  by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered  children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village  of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:  There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.  Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and  spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about  25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140   centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,  children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of  rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.  A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators  for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov  to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be   proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's  disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,  instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely  reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told  the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more  licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent  and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity  and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,  the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and  claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.  An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command  narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:  The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut  out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.  The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men   of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they  took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people  among this group were able to save their lives as the result of  my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were   released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.   Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the  Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered  on the streets.  On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent  Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were  threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for  murdering an innocent Turk.   When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would   be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare  you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the   Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard  that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within  the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same   day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to  him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible  act. However no result was achieved.  In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a  natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived  the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the   Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had  been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.   The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed  one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached  three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details  of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers  were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even  withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred  people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading  Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.  However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with  the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower  classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders  of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.   I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals  were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who  opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that  it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.  Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian  cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have  supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred  to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by  the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.  You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a  conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear  of the Turkish soldiers.""

"talk.politics.mideast",76334,"Elias' initial statement certain *is* hot air. But it seems to be almost standard procedure around here to first throw out an absurb, overstated image in order to add extra ""meaning"" to the posting's *real point*.  However, his second statement *is* quite real. The essential sealing off of Gaza residents from the possibility of making a living *has happened*. Certainly, the Israeli had a legitimate worry behind the action they took, but isn't that action a little draconian?"
"talk.politics.mideast",76335,"   O.K., its my turn: 	  DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA ?!    I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed    to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their    plan !    (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity    since it was coined by Bnai Brith)    What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,    is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic    Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in    Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.    However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their    homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political    thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the    Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.    As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.    Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true    super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the    Jews used to establish their state : Religion.    Ahmed. Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the ""Zionist entity"". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses. Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it. Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel. It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews. Harry."
"talk.politics.mideast",76336,"Absolutely. I'm sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased if the fighters (military, guerilla, whatever) would just take their argument elsewhere, find an unpopulated area somewhere, and slug it out.   At that point, we will all breath a sigh of relief *and* cheer for our side in the struggle."

"talk.politics.mideast",76338,"I don't, though when I was in Israel I did make a point of listening to JTV news, as well as Monte Carlo Radio.  In the United States, I generally read the NYT, and occasionally, a mainstream Israeli newpaper. What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer representative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and left-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past, more than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining and promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud at the time).  The paper that I would recommend reading, being middle stream and factual is ""Ha-Aretz"" - or at least this was the case two years ago. And what about the ""Nat'l Enquirer""? 8^) But seriously, if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers one could arrive at other conclusions.

"talk.politics.mideast",76342,"Proven?  Maybe not.  But it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt.  This statement and statements like it are a matter of public record.  Before the Six Day War (1967) I think Nasser and some other Arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on Arab radio.  You might want to check out some old newspapers Ahmed. I think if you take a look at the Hamas covenant (written in 1988) you might get a  different impression.

"talk.politics.mideast",76343,"In a previous article, cpr@igc.apc.org (Center for Policy Research) says: Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to ""expand its borders"" on the holiest day of the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973.  Oh wait, you chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact  OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that  the borders could be expanded.    Steve"
"talk.politics.mideast",76344,"In a previous article, cpr@igc.apc.org (Center for Policy Research) says: You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country. No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any ""employees"" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement. This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.   Steve"
"talk.politics.mideast",76345,"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis To:  shaig@Think.COM Subject: Ten questions to Israelis Dear Shai, Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory. In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ? In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982). Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty. Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ? You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength. I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth."
"talk.politics.mideast",76346,"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis Dear Josh I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions. Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers. 1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ? 2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question. 3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ? 4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned. 5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ? 6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ? 7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ? 8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ? 9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory. I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments. Elias"

The Hirgun, and other branch - off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives. 	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so.

You will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show some regard for objectivity.  Or you can continue to show what an anti-Israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.'  You ought to know that you are a laughing stock, your 'Center' is considered a joke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt to be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns, bigots, and idiots of Usenet."

"talk.politics.mideast",76356,"Is any education a prerequisite for employment at IHR ? Is it true that IHR really stands for Institution of Hysterical Reviews? Curious minds would like to know... Hap"
"talk.politics.mideast",76357,"A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information. The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially. I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from ""Israeli expansionism"". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it. With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible. Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a ""center for policy research"".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing ""state secrets"" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of ""Secrets of state"", something which every democratic govt has. I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours. This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation. Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such questions are often termed ""tabloid journalism"" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture. My answers were not any more ""hysterical"" than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You fall into the same category of those who seek ""yes"" ""no"" answers when the real answer is ""of sorts"". I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect.  The color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness. Ditto."

"talk.politics.mideast",76360,"Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing  Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For  instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what  really happened.  There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee  Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society,  the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation,  the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek  Men's Lycee Foundation.   As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish'  in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court. In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority  complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye.  The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.' It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy. The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.  The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region. And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation,  Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of  Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina.  His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in  24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job.  Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled   'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.' The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.  The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers. Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians. It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe. An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there.  Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana. Now wait, there is more.

The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus    and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered    to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their    husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age    were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst    the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a    captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities    had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.    2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from    her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript    of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.    3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the    following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire    and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt    end of a gun.    4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls    and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers    in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house    near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath    by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.    5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and    dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then    killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been    no more heard of.    6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded    by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.    The Greeks killed also many Jews.

"talk.politics.mideast",76361,"Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.  In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2] [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

"talk.politics.mideast",76363,"Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished  of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only  the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian  Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of  Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines  genocide as acting with a    'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'  History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.  The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories. The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government. The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so.  They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when  people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and  where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.""[1] ""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel). ""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.""[2] ""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3] ""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey, however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection."" ""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition  to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this  sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of  priests.""

Did the Israelis change so radically so quickly or have reporting attitudes changed? When the Jews were powerless, they did what they could to help others, which was obviously quite limited.  Later, liberated American Jews were on the forefront of the civil-rights movement.  The Jewish government of Israel rescued Jews ranging in skin color from White Russian to Brown Yemenite to Black Ethiopian.  Please, Andi, tell us ""how the Jews are treating other races when they got power."" Your ignorance and bias are indeed unfortunate."

It had something to do with not wanting to suffer the fate of your mother, who has lived with Jews for a long time or somesuch.  Sounded awful. Are you as concerned about peace and justice in Palestine (Jordan)? Let's say that Israel grants the PLO _EVERYTHING THEY EVER ASKED FOR_. That Israel goes back to the 1967 borders.  What will the ""Palestinean Arabs"" in Tel-Aviv call themselves?  The Palestineans in West Jerusalem?  In Haifa?  Will they still claim to be ""occupied""? Or do you suggest that Israel expell or kill off any remaining Arabs, much as the Arabs did to their Jews? Indeed, there is much which is not symmetrical about the conflict in the M.E.  And most of this lack of symmetry does NOT favor Israel."

Born 1959    Teacher    Sumgait Secondary School No. 10    Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10    Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office    Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15    Microdistrict No. 3    Sumgait [Azerbaijan] [Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in   Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights  organizations - DD] I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into ""before"" and ''after."" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened. Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't. That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us. In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman. My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, ""Run to the kitchen for a knife."" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  ""No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment."" We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, ""Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children."" She said this to Father in Armenian. There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: ""You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,"" and  so on and so forth, ""and we came to do the same thing to you."" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher. So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: ""I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!"" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, ""Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?"" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, ""What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them."" They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, ""What did we do to you? What did we do to you?"" And even later, when she came to,  she said, ""Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?"" That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find. Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, ""Let's take her  outside."" Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them. When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  ""forget,"" you have to forget, you have to go on living. At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness. I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living. There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me ""daughter,"" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it. I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive. And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  ""You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,"" he says, ""nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again."" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry ""Marina!"" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . . At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, ""Igor, help!"" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors. And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me. Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, ""She's already dead, let's throw her out."" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: ""Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher."" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more. What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later. Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, ""He was there,"" and a little while  later, ""Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he."" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility. Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album. He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, ""Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live."" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then. Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair. The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, ""I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'."" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, ""I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing."" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left. I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me. At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, ""Neighbor, is that you?"" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, ""Enough, let's go to the third entryway."" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other. Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: ""Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here."" That's just what he said, ""those Azerbaijanis,"" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, ""I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.""  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the ""general,"" said that they were going to the third entryway. Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall. I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, ""Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive."" He told me all this in Armenian. Then he returned to the others and said, ""What are you waiting for? Leave!""  They said, ""Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to."" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, ""Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?"" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them. We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, ""I'm an Azerbaijani."" He said, ""I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place."" She says, ""Fine, have her come in."" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, ""Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?"" She says, ""No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian."" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, ""You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else."" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment. I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her. While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, ""How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places."" Another one says,  ""Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave."" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left. Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite  frequently, ""Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let  them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians."" Then they  said, ""Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!"" They repeated it  very often. 		     - - - reference for #008 - - - [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

"talk.politics.mideast",76392,"     Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #008 Part B                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh 				(Part B of #008) ...continued from PART A: The six of them left. They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the  physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had  an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this  went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and  was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . . Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I  want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am  silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place,  telling him, ""I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring  her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse."" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his  apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were  walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls.  There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps. They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I  went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be  cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the  doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth,  opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle  Sabir's son started to shout, ""Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!"" He  knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma.  Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their  apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there. At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment. Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, ""Lyuda,  Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes  you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful."" It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one  side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her  cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, ""Fine."" Mamma was  afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started  to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye  that was intact, looked at me, and said, ""Who is it?"" But I could barely talk,  my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, ""My Karochka, my Karina, my  little golden one . . . "" She understood me. Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips.  She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't  understand it. Then I made out, ""It hurts, I hurt all over."" Her hair was  glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her  forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how  to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil  and paper and says, ""Write it down."" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I  can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me  something, but she couldn't. I say, ""Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then."" And then she says, ""Maybe it'll be too late."" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself. Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She  says, ""Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this  damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan."" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I  understood her every word. I ask, ""What's his number?"" Urshan Feyruzovich,  that's the head of the administration where she works. ""We have to call him.""  But I didn't know his home number. I say, ""Karina, what's his number?"" She  says, ""I can't remember."" I say, ""Who knows his number? Who can I call?"" She  says, ""I don't know anything, leave me alone."" I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was  crying, too. I say, ""Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can  we call him? Who knows his telephone number?"" I tell Marina, ""Think, think,  who can we call to find out?"" She started calling; several people didn't  answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and  found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he  was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says,  ""Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and  tell them that they just can't do that."" She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, ""It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's  happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single  Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised  that we managed to save ourselves. ""She says, ""Well, OK, if it's that serious  . . . "" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up  and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. ""OK,  fine, fine,"" she says, ""if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back  I'll send him over."" We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly  under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She  wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed  everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and  finally we get through. She says, ""Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your  place now."" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either,  because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep  with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what  shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has  grown up daughters, they're almost my age. The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No,  first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I  saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war. They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older  Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud  she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle  Arkady, I think, because someone said ""Arkady, get an injection ready,"" he  started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But  when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his  sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and  started to cry: ""What have they done to you?!"" He was speaking Armenian. ""What have they done to you?!"" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and  she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. ""I'll give you a shot.""  Mamma tells him, ""I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what  are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!"" Some teacups were standing on the table in  there. ""You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my  daughters! Look what they've turned them into!"" They gave her something to  drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa  and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina  out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I  don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: ""What's  the matter with you?"" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, ""I'm fine."" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told  the doctor, ""You leave, let a woman examine her."" A woman came, an  Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" I was wearing my  sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When  she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would  be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge  wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said  something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be  dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital. They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me.  I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't  know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, ""Lie still, you mustn't move."" When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed  very familiar to me. I shouted, ""Stop!"" One of the policemen turned and says,  ""What do you want?"" I say, ""Bring him to me, I want to look at him."" They  brought him over and I said, ""That person was just in our apartment and he  just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down."" They said,  ""Fine,"" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were  taking him. Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were  sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car  up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, ""Sister . . . "" I don't  remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said that he was from Ufa.  Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I  learned that they suffered most of all. He says, ""OK, you're Armenians, they  didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,"" he says, ""what are they trying  to kill me for?"" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the  balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw  two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed  against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried ""Mamma"" made my skin crawl. I don't know  what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before  he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was  Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with  someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the  yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian. They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too  and said, ""I've been beaten too, help me."" But they just ignored her. My  father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault  that he'd been beaten, and says, ""My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have  probably broken my ribs. Please look at them."" The doctor says, ""That's not my job."" Urshan said, ""Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor,  I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them  to his apartment. Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the  doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I  wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, ""No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like  they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. ""Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same  story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no  drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at  zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from  seeing it. They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have  any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their  place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira  her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she  involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful  when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, ""Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone."" Well, they did what they  wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I  would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It  was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do  every day: steal, kill, rape . . . Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts  explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those  children would be grown, and then, as they put it, ""we'll come take the  pleasure out of their lives, those children."" This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow  because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be  of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the  victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that. And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many  people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know  why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before,  maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and  they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at  nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with  Marina: ""Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over  there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman  shouldn't see such things."" So they were really quite sober . . . So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all  happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several  hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: ""Listen,"" he'll say, ""what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?"" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen.  That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of  course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present. On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city,  the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier.  There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family  there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They  were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife  and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying. Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: ""We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct."" We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to  have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful.  They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you  could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the  police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is  surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were  standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought  great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't  just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost  family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened  when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret  room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those  people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the  hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my  parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should  attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an  Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and  she wouldn't be able to take it. Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people  climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We  calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some  little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never  have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people  do eat. Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They  were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from  the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a  different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing,  and calling out: ""Oh, Rafik!,"" but when she heard about this such a rage came  over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her  sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were  soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash  him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not  one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from  doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands,  muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing  terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the  creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did  this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She  went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women,  ""What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they  raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though  nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?"" She appealed to everyone, but no  one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I  could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so  many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the  elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time.  There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking.  The situation was deplorable. At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen,  Azerbaijanis. They said, ""Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed."" Now the women didn't want to leave this place,  either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with  dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, ""Oh, it's our little  family,"" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for  the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, ""Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard."" Our people would say, ""Oh, that's all right."" They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs. They took us up to the second floor and said, ""You can undress and sleep in  here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city."" This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I  asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, ""Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, ""Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything."" When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met  acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who  hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with  them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had  come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like  they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people,  hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of  course the stories and the talk were flying: ""Oh, I heard that they killed  him!"" ""What do you mean they killed him!"" ""He stayed at work!"" ""Do you know  what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that. And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very  well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small  room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night  talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary  of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see  Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed  from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask  him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by  soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with  the people. Apparently he had more important things to do. Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, ""Lyudochka, find another  two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs,  lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people  who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned."" I  had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, ""Lyuda, your  Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are  alive and well and that you're here."" I gave the lists to someone and asked  them to continue what I was doing and went off. The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the  name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said  that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later  it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for  Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that  in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored  missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3 All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were  contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple  of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, ""What's  going on?"" He said, ""Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty."" They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26  people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only  a half of those that were on the first list. He said, ""Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more."" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people  whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many  people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the  Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that  there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical  Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk  cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went  to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the  Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list  drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to  publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court,  they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No.  8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know  her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in  Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the  same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding  the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and  when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her  braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because  they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one  . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore. They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there  and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina;  it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could  already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the  social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said,  ""If it weren't for the work I would go insane."" He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers  and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything,  although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been  dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it  was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue. On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered  only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims. Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I  told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind.  We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor  quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there  weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a  curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or  video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that  we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially  to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to  Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with  Bibishev, I told him myself, ""Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two  months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation."" He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, ""How long can you go on like  this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you."" Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary  confinement. Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma  identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify  anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the  photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one  who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the  loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know  his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his  sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that  even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will  continue looking for him. The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various  plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me ""I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia,"" that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, ""Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order."" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk. The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was  in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and  all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned  them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James  Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were  boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had  been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's  enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did  take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out  slippers. Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait.  Basically, the group that went seeking ""revenge""--let's use their word for  it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with  one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that  black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of  Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I  don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an  Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know  nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an  axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and  threw them into the tub with water. I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You  know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both  their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I  identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How  did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I  kept thinking, is that Rita or ""puma,"" which it would be if you read the word  as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic ""T"" was the one  that looks like a Latin ""M."" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and  told me that I was making a mistake, and called me ""dear sister."" He said,  ""You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an  Armenian,"" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator  asked me, ""Lyuda, are you sure it was he?"" I told him, ""I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The  name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand."" He went rigid and became  pale. They told him, ""Put your hands on the table."" He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, ""Now turn your hands over,"" but he didn't  turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they  forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, ""No, I did not do anything, it wasn't  me."" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out  of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it.  Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and  back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how,  but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or  strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the  microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, ""Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . "" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped.  They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down,  because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, ""You're  some actress! What a performance!"" I said, ""Tolya, honestly . . . "" Beforehand they would always tell me, ""Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if  nothing had happened to you."" I say, ""I don't have any more strength or  emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength  . . . I don't have the strength to do anything."" And he says, ""Lyuda, how were you able to do that?"" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, ""Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped  that high in gym class."" So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of  the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who  beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis. At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his  guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said,  ""Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock."" He said, ""No, I'm not coming."" They told him, ""If you don't come  we'll kill you."" He said, ""Alright, I'll come."" And he went. They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a  motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him  out of his apartment and told him the same thing: ""Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there."" He said, ""No."" They pulled a knife on him. He said,  ""I'm not going all the same."" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed  him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that  we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th. I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our  apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our  apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I  don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment. At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't  have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita. The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, ""I don't  understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head."" But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they  crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were  promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, ""they  promised us apartments."" Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a  children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at  the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they  have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or  grandparents. And he said, ""I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my  own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing."" And the whole time I kept repeating, ""Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife  right before your own eyes."" He sat there and just wailed. But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a  marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just  have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how  to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he  knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed  himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained. That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr  Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, ""Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here."" Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was  that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They  liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When  Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors  old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to  the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were  already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have  sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older  woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of  Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands  and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth,  he sees everything, and He won't forgive this. There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first  floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is  tantamount to trampling a woman's honor. Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we  have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these  events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come  about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that  without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not  have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their  nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are  a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they  threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone  who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them. February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came  into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had  been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for  a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few  teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or  seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there  were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the  evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and  the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the  microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the  driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: ""Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!"" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because  people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The  woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians  cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, ""Sons, avenge my daughters!"" That  was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the  direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street. We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a  very nationalist speech. He said, ""Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!"" This  he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him  stormily, whistling and shouting ""Karabagh!"" He said, ""Karabagh has been our  territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my  heart?"" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. ""It's our  territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated.  From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years  the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth."" By filth he meant  Armenians. I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with  the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, ""Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's  spouting,"" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we  listened to the woman's speech. Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the  subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to  obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, ""Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If  they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I  tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?"" When he  said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a  second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered,  ""No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until  twelve. Stay here."" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in  kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: ""I left my  children at the kindergarten."" The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, ""Good-bye,"" and left with the young teacher, the  Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that. When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too  much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed  off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher  wouldn't say that I was an Armenian. To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at  the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched  television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last  day. That's how it all was. At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store  on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she  doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father  held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the  ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went  out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the  entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders  there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the  moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been  injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor,  and their children: any way they could.  Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin,  Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims  what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one  another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even  with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and  their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got  them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked  electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then  they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an  Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to  escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of  course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The  Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored  personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored  personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that  very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves. I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big,  strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a  strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother. One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking  for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected,  people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps  dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went  with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found  Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and  put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or  infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the  neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject  came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the  basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing  as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor  took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything  seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing  of ours he had managed to ""save."" Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended  themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some  reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just  victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too.  In the TV show ""Pozitsiya"" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that  the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not  important, the truth will come out regardless. So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our  bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the  years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've  become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who. On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans  will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the  Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on  the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.

"talk.politics.mideast",76393,"Dear folks, I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment. It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.  It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.  It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before. Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading. To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.  I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer. Elias"

"talk.politics.mideast",76483,"Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same ""mandate territory"" - read colony. Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started. Again territorial expansion by force. The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island). So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation. They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population. The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as ""public land"". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.  No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice. Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks, Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else. If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply. Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel. The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank. Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else. The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.  The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.  Phill Hallam-Baker "
"talk.politics.mideast",76484,"   I have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by this anti-Israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable sounding name of the 'Center for Policy Research.'  Obviously, it is no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so.      Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising in itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was curious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind his phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it there, and is now taking his failure out on Israel?

"talk.politics.mideast",76485,"            NEWS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED, APR 19, 1993           Not because you were too busy but because             Israelists in the US media spiked it.                   THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS  Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip   during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the   Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.  The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of  the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for  Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and  occupied West Bank.  Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked  soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,   the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.  On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their  pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents   are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.  The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth  escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur   Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them   against a wall, and put their arms around them.  When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat  him with the butts of their rifles.  On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising  Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the   soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the   beating.  On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded  him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As  the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.      The army said it was checking the reports.       ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM  Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday   to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.  Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after  soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.      ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy  Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father  George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.      Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of  Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.     Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation  of requesting permits to reach holy sites.      Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement  to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian  celebrations.      ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.  But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.      An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.

It depends which of those territories you refer to. In general, settlers were moved into the territories because at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the logical move.

Mr. Baker, to address all of your points would be impossible, but in a  nutshell, it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in Lebanon without attacking Syria.  Syrian occupation has been hostile, and amounts to annexation.  Israel's is clearly defensive.  If it  were not defensive, you would see all of Lebanon occupied, and governed by Israel.

"talk.politics.mideast",76497,"     Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violatins in Azerbaijan #009                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh DEPOSITION OF ROMAN ALEKSANDROVICH GAMBARIAN    Born 1954    Senior Engineer    Sumgait Automotive Transport Production Association    Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 40    Microdistrict No. 3    Sumgait [Azerbaijan] What happened in Sumgait was a great tragedy, an awful tragedy for us, the  Armenian people, and for all of mankind. A genocide of Armenians took place during peacetime. And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in those days. He was still young. Born in 1926. On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there  was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we  didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd  near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home  watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir  Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our  house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the  direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and  started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off  the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know  and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment. Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us: there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War  II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot. We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down  with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, ""What's going on? What's  happened?"" They say, ""Armenians, get out of here!"" We don't open the door, we  say, ""If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow."" They say, ""No,  leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!"" By now they've  broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other.  We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment, and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We  held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an  axe, and then with a crowbar. When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them  with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars,  pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father  in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured  several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But  they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there were many of them. The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go  into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought  skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father  bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head,  and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw  that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the  bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in  there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to  chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of  about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and  started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no  one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader  of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a  fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: ""What's with you,  woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?"" She says, ""What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!"" My father  was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian  and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says,  ""The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he  brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person."" He says, ""You  don't need to shout, stop shouting."" And when they heard the voice of this  man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and  started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left,  too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't  know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started  to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to  call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all  evening and all through the night. Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were  from Khachmas. They said, ""We heard that a group was here at your place, you  have our condolences."" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay in the room. So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well, we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around  one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy,  investigators. They say, ""Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back  here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything."" Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take  Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take  Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times, but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the  neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should  hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and  went up to the neighbor's. The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles, ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a  landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings 19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking  into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians  weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they  poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were  some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. ""They're up there, still, up there. Let's go kill them!"" They broke up all the furniture remaining in  the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding  one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door  shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling  the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it,  and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, ""No, that's from some of the  furniture."" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed  him down. The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and  went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also Armenians, they had left for another city. The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, ""Are you  crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the  apartments? They could kill you and them!"" And to us :"" . . . Come on, leave  this apartment!"" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went  downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the  other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down.  They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal  they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom. With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were  saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely  accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the  crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on  the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We  were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the  troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been  even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the  genocide. Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the  leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their  orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to ' pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock  in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was  quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried  Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were  about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It  was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people  there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well,  there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It  was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The  child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a  man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces  were disfigured, they were in such awful condition... Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what  happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my  father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue. I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what  happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history. I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel  mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They  weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our  troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The  inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the  soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They  weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were  at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket  office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing  Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that  they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department  came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though perhaps they could have come and saved us. As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus  station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in  fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in  which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had lists, the bandits. You can tell that the ""operation"" was  planned in advance. Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops  suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my  family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time. At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could  happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds. Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass  disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught, very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There  were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took  part in the pogrom of our building all in all. They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that  retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

"talk.politics.mideast",76498,"This could be accomplished by other criteria.  One must remember that children often bring stress into households. As an alternative, one could consider financial incentives for every sexual act performed by two partners of different ethnic backgrounds.  The plan could be entitled ""PEACE INCOME SEXUAL SECURITY"", or PISS for short. Every time an Israeli gets screwed by a Palestinian or visa versa, they would be eligible for income. In keeping with the spirit of the times, condoms would be a tax deductible expense.  This policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor would it apply to domestic animals of either nationality. Joint Palestinan-Israeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all acts were voluntary and promptly rewarded. The teams of Palestinian-Israel Morals Patrols, or PIMPS, would receive a percentage of the financial income in order to encourage their participation and add to their incentive in locating suitable candidates.

The best thing the  Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifada and try to live as normally as possible (I know, it's hard under occupation).

"talk.politics.mideast",76512,"There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin which admits a massacre at Deir Yassin.  Thus, Hasan is wrong. The word ""troops"" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account. Incidentally, ""three times as heavy"" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why. As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning. It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan. Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp. Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?

Obviously, Israeli authorities do recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports, consular services, etc...

Ostensibly, this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov't, though this is not the general case. From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for ""ultimate borders"" (is this a game like ""ultimate frisbee""?) extending into  other countries. Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no. If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron. That having been said, I deny the above.

"talk.politics.mideast",76530," 	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday  there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than  ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator  told him to do just that.  	``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told  Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia-  Herzegovina.  	Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for  what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of   ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of  civilians.  	``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact  that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones  and we ought to pick a couple.''  	Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the  former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have  a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.  	Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to  the radical Islamic government of Iran. O, I C!    Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged   eastern town of Srebrenica.   	``There's not a military person...who will not tell you that they   could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry   around Srebrenica,'' Biden said.   	``If you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have   saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred   right now.''   	Military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the   equation,'' Biden said.   	Despite the frustrations and pressure, Christopher had no enthusiasm   for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia-   Herzegovina. Humanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed. 	             *******(then) 	*******************(Now) Why don't they get the hell out of there, they ared doing nothing to protect the victims anyway.. Maybe becasue they have a different agenda. Now that they made sure the Bosnian (who were the only real subject of the embargo last year, as everybody knows that the Serbs had an unlimited supply of arms) wre massacred without having a chance to defend themselves, Now this evil coldhearted snake is saying ""it is too late to save them, so let them die."

"talk.politics.mideast",76532,"	And Lebanon has a right to make this decision without Syrian troops controlling the country.  Until Syria leaves, and free elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese would even be involved in determining what happens to their country. 	I expect you will agree that the same holds true for Syria having no right to be in Lebanon? 	The UN also thought Zionism is racism.  That fails to make it true. 	They lasted weeks against tanks in '48, and stopped those tanks from advancing.  They also lasted days in '73.  There is little evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities. 	They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take place over the Jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are usually picked up in the morning. 	Nonsense.  Israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the negotiating table for 40 years.  It was the gulf war that brought the arabs to the table, not the Israelis. 	Nonsense.  According to Arafat, Israel must be destroyed.  He has never come clean and denied that this is his plan.  He always waffles on what he means. 	``When the Arabs set off their volcano, there will only be Arabs in 	this part of the world.

"talk.politics.mideast",76534,"The ADC is an organization of Arab-*AMERICANS*. Let me see...you're saying that ""most if not all"" Arab-AMERICANS should be spied on?  You're also saying that ""most if not all"" Arab-AMERICANS should be views as a national security threat to Israel (and the US,  as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing, in  which no Arab-AMERICANS were involved)?  By inference, can we assume  that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses  a threat to Israel and, therefore, should be spied on? Perhaps, then, on the basis of Pollard spy case (not to mention the Rosenbergs, etc.) you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied  on by the ADC. Oh, never mind; this whole spying case has obviously so  convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have  no wish confuse you further. So the LA times reporter who had information about him sold to the South African government was involved in ""anti-Israel activity or propaganda""? Are we to infer that the simple act of reporting an event in a newspaper constitutes ""anti-Israel activity or propaganda""?  Or was it South Africa?  The LA  times reporter was based in South Africa, after all. "
