An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated that ""this would clean up things once and for all"". If the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI has indicated they will ""burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco"".  It hasn't been decided how the new proposed ""energy tax"" will enter into this, an IRS representative stated ""We're looking at the tax code to determine if taxes really end at death.

"talk.politics.guns",54554,"And you'd be wrong about that too. Note that Texas isn't unique in this ""more with-gun deaths than with-car deaths"", but some of the other states where it happens have extremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the ""meaning"". It isn't clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car accidents are unintentional while gun deaths aren't, but if we're going to make it, let's at least be honest. Give it up for what?  Gun control doesn't have any benefits, so it fails by this standard. Note that insurance gives me something in return - gun control doesn't. That's half the question - the rest is ""and what do you get for your sacrifice"".  If the answer to the second question is ""nothing"", as it is for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified."

"talk.politics.guns",54558,"To Rob and all others that have been debating about the wood stove.    The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the  building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit  for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims  that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours. I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS gas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY  uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in  the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less  eat.  So my question now is ""why were they cooking food?""    I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire. But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more crazy than the ATF/FBI claim). Michael"

"talk.politics.guns",54561,"Mark 'Mark' Sachs <MBS110@psuvm.psu.edu>, representing the Students for  Well, I only saw it start in one place.  A tank punched a hole in a wall, and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that a 30+ mph wind was blowing.  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday, and fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made.  A terrible, negligent accident. Maybe they couldn't.  I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire, but it happens all the time. What if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know about the fire until it surrounded them?  Remember the Israelis hiding in sealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas-bearing Scuds? Cripes, Mark, are you REALLY a college student?  Maybe you ought to stop worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head. Ever heard of questioning authority?  OK, I'll buy that.  You _do_ seem totally clueless... contrary.  Wellllll....  They weren't murderous.  They'd never harmed or even threatened  anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons and hardware.  And as far as ""evidence"", what are you talking about?   Everything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get questioned in detail about it.  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage Access buddies, sitting around the bar slurring stuff like ""they shoulda killed 'em all 51 days ago"" don't feel that way, but then you're probably one of those people still saying about Klinton ""Give the guy a chance, we don't even know what he's gonna do!

Of course, it took him the better part of 4 years to do it;  Slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots of them.  Anddd...  I imagine he'll also be held accountable for that. (I can just see the campaign buttons now:   ""ABC - Anybody But Clinton"") Hmmm.... Apparently you just got here.  Nobody's claiming that it was anything but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally don't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up.  And as far as how they picked the Davidians, who knows?  Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie. Maybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs during their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the timing of the raid) rather than running into resistance.  Maybe they KNEW that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are trying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing on the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case.  Of course, their reasoning doesn't matter, only what they did, and this time, people are just paying more attention to it. Not if you mean that stupid ""don't stop thinking about tomorrow""...

"talk.politics.guns",54575,"*sigh* It is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers, or re-assign them to administrative (non enforcement) duties, while an investigation into possible misconduct is going on. The Administration has given no indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the decisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all activities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates to an enforced vacation."

"talk.politics.guns",54580,"Here goes: More than a few years back (if you were born that year, you can legally drink), we tried it out.  We found an 8 ft. deep cistern that we lined with some 10 ft. 2X6s.  We put a large can (one of those industrial sized pork'n beans cans) stuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom.  After lighting the fire, we LOWERED a box of .38 Spc. SWCs into the can.  We heard pops, one solid bang and several ""fizzzz shussss"".  After we thought the excitment was over, we boldly climbed down to find that NONE of the bullets had left the can, several of the shells were lieing around the bottom of the well and the boards had all died of smoke inhalation.

"talk.politics.guns",54582,"  I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were talking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION.   A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not that wierd in Texas.  My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con- ventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person home.  Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore.  I now have my own shotgun in my apartment.   Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no, I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying that they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.   It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.   Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this) to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.   I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever  bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons, and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway.  If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that is up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per- verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something in their state. semper fi, Jammer Jim Miller  Texas A&M University '89 and '91  I don't speak for UH, which is too bad, because they could use the help.

You don't have to pay attention to any one source, neither do you have to abandon your critical thinking, but to disregard all sources of information as 'lies' and 'distortions' and substitute your own pet theories is more likely to get you wild untruths than by basing your theories on the 'facts' as they are reported by the media and the government. Actually there was evidence of the fire being set deliberately - both testamony by the survivors and IR tape showing the fire being set in 3 places AND the petrochemical soot that the fire  was giving off (indications of kerosine or gasoline feeding the fire).

"talk.politics.guns",54588,"Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth, you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with the newsreporting if you care. Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he is lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their stories to match the Feds.   Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested, but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves to the ratings and deliberately distort.   For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus  being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto, so made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).

You have very few facts about what actually happened, and what information you do have came from a  single source, the FBI/BATF.  Yet you are more than happy to pronounce the BD's guilty-as-charged based on this one-sided testimony.  Scary!"
"talk.politics.guns",54590,"Two notes of interest from Texas: The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black. The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as ""those fucking cowboys"".  The DPS was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as ""traffic cops"".  ATF now has two strikes against them. Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the flashed ""an automatic weapon"" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF."
"talk.politics.guns",54591,"In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians would have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and therefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this theory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there, and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them). While I think that Vernon started the fire (his followers anyway),  it is incidental to their reaction."

"talk.politics.guns",54602,"The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start violence. When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back. But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical attention that the BD were not looking for trouble. If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc. A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking ATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor. All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the BD."
"talk.politics.guns",54603,"Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will start small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches fire at once. This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed by those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, and broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but was really one big fire. Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them to escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room. I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final assault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show their agents of the the FBI overcoming the ""forces of evil"", aka the Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove that they were not using excessive force."

"talk.politics.guns",54606,"   From psc@sei.cmu.edu (Peter Capell) on rec.martial-arts... Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article. I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn't make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose ""the authorities"" might have been a better term than ""society"".  Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect, at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do. And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.    In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or    so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-    abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny,     though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a     lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.      IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or     a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-    grabbers' logic.   Agreed.    You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as     important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious     good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities     about something as big and diverse as US society. My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload of trouble should you be forced to use them.    Or by the    naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause     to someone who would be a criminal anyway. I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.      Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself    if others' thoughts are not that kindly, That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to  have the means to defend myself when that in not possible. I *think* we agree on this issue.  I guess my position didn't survive the transition from cognition to ASCII."

"talk.politics.guns",54618,"Saying ""hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y"" is *much* different from saying ""hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y."" Here you've made both statements. If the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy X, then perhaps policy X is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on! According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the ""leading causes of unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death.  Can't you see past the bullshit? Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I'm sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern, but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one. The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking. Sorry if it wasn't clear to me.  I thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to ""interpersonal violence."" What, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL METHODS per year?  Who do you think I should believe?  The people who call everyone up to age 24 ""children"" when they're screaming about the ""carnage of our nation's children"" being caused by handguns? Ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People 2000 document is to ""enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?""  The agency that funded the ""study"" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban had saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings? It wasn't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their ""post law"" period... Okay, I'll concede I no longer have the numbers I once read on these.  I'll retract my dispute of your numbers.  However, I would be greatly interested in seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers. What's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary school I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a problem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the car, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  The problem is not the guns, it's the parents!!! And what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns? NOTHING.  No criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even suspension.  They take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say ""ain't it awful,"" and go on as if everything's back to normal.  What's wrong with this picture? I don't think Koresh was the Messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he believed the children were much safer inside the compound?  I didn't say he was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what he thought was going on.  He thought he had them in the one place where harm *wouldn't* come to them.

It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere, and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially semi-rural areas.   This is true, but so far the FBI/BATF track record on this incident is very bad.

"talk.politics.guns",54644,"I think it was - he went into town fairly often, and was known to go jogging.  This was even during the 9 month period when he was being watched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned according to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting them, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted to have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell... He was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered peacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully). He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY. The justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased $200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period). Last I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an INDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door shoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I know of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you? I sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated like the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it is a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the BATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt people having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved religeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF these days?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT... MY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation, and NOW.  Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence. They had the premisis bugged.  I am inclined to think a further wait would have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergency gear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water when a fire was observed, instead of saying ""aw, gee, there is no water"". Why so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building had pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision the firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't the Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough... One does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'... What does 'taking responsibility' mean?  You think she is going to be facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think she is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to have acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though. I am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI. I expect to hear ""they are our best law enforcement.  They wouldn't do anything like that - NO WAY.  OUT of the QUESTION.  End of issue"". I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full prosecuting and subpoena powers.  With felony prosecution where felony acts are found. Fat chance, I bet.  I bet the Justice Dept will have an internal investigation which will turn up at most 'poor judgement'. I hope I am wrong, that this is gone over with a fine tooth comb."

Their neighbours thought they were a little strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live next door to. One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If this is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof that these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defend themselves. : Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me : they *realy* belong in society ... If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it is not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is claiming that the 'cult' started the fire. 'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but I'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say about it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same. Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident: 1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing     an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least     three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify     a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as     uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to     be police. 2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:     + ""We only had handguns"" - the original footage showed 4 BATF       officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5       assault sub-machine gun.     + ""We were out gunned"" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the       BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you       have the best guns available for the job.     + ""We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!"" -       this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot       through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that       matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and       *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly       incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are       shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter       plywood.     + ""We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.        No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.        Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.        Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.""       - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily       and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous. 3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one     of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would     mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did     AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh? All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be taken with a grain or two of salt.

The wigged gents who argued about the constituion used it in that way. Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than ""individual right, not to be interfered with by govt"".

"talk.politics.guns",54691,"I see that I misphrased my question.  I should have asked WHICH full-autos Kratz can accurately distinguish from semi-auto look-alikes.

Kratz has claimed that he can visually distinguish full-autos from semi-autos.  For which full-autos is he making that claim?  How does he do it?  Let's get specific, and as exhaustive as possible. Maybe?  Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows? Is Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from a two position switch via TV inspection?  (Does he even get to see the switch in the typical police display of guns?)  Note that one might well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection even though it won't be seen on TV.  And to think that Kratz was telling us that seeing it on TV was just as accurate as being there.... Why all the questions?  Kratz assured us that he could make this distinction and now he's asking us how he did it.... What about it?  It only demonstrates that, as I predicted, Kratz was blowing smoke on this."
"talk.politics.guns",54696,"   Did I say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent?  NO.  I hate to repeat myself Jim, but like I told Joe, I was not attempting in any way to justify gun control.  You're right, any death is serious. THAT was my point to Joe who said that ""anti-gunners"" try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem.  I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem. No, I don't want to discuss match control.  I don't equate a book of matches to a loaded 9 millimeter either.  Don't confuse the issue.  And please don't say that tired old NRA line ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"". Sure, people can kill people without guns.  But easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient.  ""Guns don't kill people, People with easy access to guns kill people"".     Jim, I'm just saying how it is.  I'm not saying if that is a good thing or not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program, they say ""well no...""  So, in answer to your question, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test evaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are essentially saying ""look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community"". If you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.   Religion has nothing to do with this.  I could care less what religion they were okay?  To put children in that situation is wrong, pure and simple.  Difference is good Jim, I am the most progressive and diverse person in the world.

"talk.politics.guns",54699,"Folks, It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging  at my gut.  The list will probably grow.  1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that      the BATF obtained? 2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition      could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a ""no-knock""      raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the       complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without       a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock       on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant       in a manner prescribed by law? 3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents      were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.      In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building      known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.      Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an      alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to      the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening      fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building?  4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that      David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over      $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the      members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms      License, were they actively participating in the legal business      of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the      weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence      consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally      dispossessed weapons. 5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,      a BATF spokeswoman stated ""We were outgunned!"".  Yet, TV newscasts      of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents      armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the      video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's      bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)      of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the       scene of the original assault on the complex? 6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the      complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a ""hostage""      situation?  7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use ""psychological warfare""      techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and      other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any       normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the       complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind? 8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex      were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable      to expect these mothers would have their children taken away      from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers      to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities? 9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch      Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members      who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an       armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a       lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident       does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the       fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.        Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle       penetrated? 10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and      the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,      bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas      within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any      known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI      have that a mass suicide pact existed? 11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on      the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition      and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be      more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas      or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence       found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition       and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,      and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were       engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the      amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect      for someone engaged in such a legal business? 12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical      news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to      crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is       there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will       be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act? 13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the      complex, ""over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.""  On the video      tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles      engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one      would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no       indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,      buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be       evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.        Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter,       sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be       apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do       any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas       into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by       shots from high-power rifles? 14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United      States has signed international treaties which prevent the use      of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use      CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally      acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land? 15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered      in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had      been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county      coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet      wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within      the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?"

The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of Koresh saying, ""light the fire"", and you can have one. Need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of computer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time.

"talk.politics.guns",54710,"This is the AP story from Fri morning. As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and  checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the     compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.    This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the  six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world     since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's  phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.     They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what     was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors. Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air, driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to  find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.   Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of  propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house, it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked  together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others died groping in the blackness. Frank"

"talk.politics.guns",54713,"Feel free to patronize me all you like; I need the tips. :-) Seriously, if you were insulted, I apologize. People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to consider reasonable alternatives. However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's no longer necessary to be an ""independent thinker"" to depart from the government's party line.  It looks like our ""independent press"" may  actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is a good sign.  I hope it continues. Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one set of facts are being presented, ""coming to a conclusion"" is not the  hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability to challenge those ""facts"" critically.  The scientific method consists of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing between two hypotheses that other people have proposed."

"talk.politics.guns",54736,"The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows. The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) ""Gun Stats"" The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: The study gives the impression that, if you own a  gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to  defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you.  The study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun  to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample  size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be  used, successfully, by a private citizen against an  aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a  gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies  also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can  be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F. Taylor CU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry"

"talk.politics.guns",54746,"This claim hasn't been retracted or contradicted yet, as many earlier government claims have?  At least one clip showed a fire erupting after a tank busted in a wall.  We have unsubstantiated claims by the government about the FLIRs spotting ""simultaneous"" fires. That's easy.  Six hours of CS gas, heavy smoke from a rapidly spreading fire, confusion, panic.  Only 10% got out.  The building was collapsing all around them and finding the way out was a matter of luck. The Davidians may have committed suicide, or some few zealots among them might have started the fires -- that is possible.  But, given the government's earlier inability to tell a straight story, I find my above scenario equally possible.  I wait for some independent investigation to look into the whole thing. It would be one thing if the government spokespeople had been consistent and forthright throughout.  Keeping the press far away and ghettoized in ""pools"" was not conducive to building up trust. Sealing the warrants was non-optimal, as well.  This operation was out of control from the git-go. Speaking only for myself, I think Bush and Reagan should have been impeached over Iran-Contra. In 1979, I would probably have given the benefit of the doubt to the government.  No more.

"talk.politics.guns",54751,"Funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no evidence ONE WAY or ANOTHER that there were bullet wounds -- not a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are deemed speculative.

Also, pretty disappointed at being ignored by the coutnry."
"talk.politics.guns",54752,"Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the  compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes  from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout.  Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits  required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally  out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local  community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By  the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame  and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers  and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck,  but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not  have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the  line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient  equipment and water to make a difference. They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia  asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably  irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local  calls could get through. ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who  viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the  standard ""pool shot""), and agreed that the fire a) must have been  started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant  to spread so fast. Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed  themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot  stronger proof than some of the ""theories"" floating around the net. Score 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians. Or is that -89 Branch Davidians?"
"talk.politics.guns",54753,"Apparently needing to clarify his comments from Thursday, Dr. Nizam Plawaby (spelling?), the Medical Examiner for Tarrant County, Texas, who has authority in the Waco deaths, stated that since no autopsies had been performed, there is no evidence for bullet wounds, or  evidence against bullet wounds. Janet Reno also stated that she had never been told of bullet wounds by anyone in the Justice Department.  "

Their discussions with the survivors differ from the FBI account.  The attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns in the compound which started the fires. Government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other  throughout this whole affair.  I'll wait for some better evidence before I form an opinion."
"talk.politics.guns",54770,"started!"". not  It's also what you say when you're waiting for the end to come in a  ""fiery apocalypse""...just a thought. Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything ""new"" that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't it be more ""reasonable"" to believe the BD's would set the fire early after the assault began?   The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter (watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously. Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been  penetrating a few feet. reserving judgement,"

And they are very, very good about it, in both the tactical and legal parts of it.

But the public must question why agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury. 	The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness.

It had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside ""Rancho Apocalypse"" were essentially  hostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no reason for the government to be impatient.

[Points made by Dick DeGueran, Koresh's lawyer] Okay, their word against the FBI's at this point.  See ya in court! Dear, dear. They could have COME OUT. Okay, they were living in a fire hazard. That they built. No crime, irrelevant either way. Ah yes, that is exactly what I would do.  Hold Bible study. Take a nap. Always a wise course of action when you're being gassed. I don't believe there was a ""suicide pact"".  I believe that Koresh wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers. In fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories. Yes, that's right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where did they expect to go? The building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS?  That's almost as bad as running into a fire. Hm, an interesting notion.  We'll see. More Bible study, no doubt.  Hey, it's a *priority*. Actually, on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and he could not flatly contradict the federal agents' claims.  We'll know more later.  In any event, it's irrelevant. For six hours they were trapped?  The building was not ""destroyed""  immediately.  They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY TIME. Six hours to move it away.  Or COME OUT. Irrelevant, anyway.  PR one way or the other, but no crime or innocence indicated. No word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative question here. Right.  For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at  any point, and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN BURNING.  Near BALES OF HAY. It's ultimately irrelevant who ""lit"" the fire.  They had ample opportunity to LEAVE. Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  They tend to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators.  (Ex.: Ted Bundy.) Medical assistance was jsut a phone call away.  Gee, all he had to do was COME OUT. Not relevant to any crimes. While he was there.  Anyway, outsiders RARELY see abuse.  It's a secretive thing.  All we have to go on are the court documents in the Jewell case and the mistrial in California. EXACTLY.  By their OWN CHOICE. Looks like there will be several investigations, starting with Congressional committee hearings next week.... I have NEVER judged them by their religion, but by their ACTIONS. If they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  Instead, they chose courses of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID, if not IRRATIONAL.  The first was to stockpile weapons.  The second was to shoot federal agents.  The third was to stay inside. Just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy weapon at him, I don't think the FBI deserves blame in this case."
"talk.politics.guns",54849,"Though David Sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the Second Amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out  of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active  threads discussing EXACTLY this topic which at least explore the fallacies  of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them. Basic fact #1, Mr. Sternlight:  The RIGHT described is a ""right of the people to keep and bear arms;"" not a ""right of the people to form a militia,"" a ""right of a militia to keep and bear arms,"" or a ""right of well-regulated people to keep and bear arms.""

"talk.politics.guns",54853,"OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion. You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family against this attack b) realize ""oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I  better surrender"" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do what they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you  defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to  charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological  warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it. I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to  surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted search warrant.   Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now  playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of  Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been held off in their assault."

If they hadn't been stockpiling weapons, then the ATF wouldn't have felt  threatened and had to move in.  Here's a newsflash:  It isn't illegal to own more than one firearm.  It isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms.   They shot federales?  The feds shot them, too.     How about that staying inside thing?  Here's another newsflash:  sometimes the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.

I didn't realize that over a hundred million gun owners all posted to tpg.

Speaking of which...       Most of the ""readership"" posts I've seen put the most read newsgroups at about 160,000 readers, a number I have a feeling is fairly inflated.  The posters, rare and regular, are themseleves a very tiny minority of that group.  And the whole of Usenet readers are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.        If anything, the only real thing you can get out of the relative sample of Usenet readers is that we've got too much equipment and too much time available to us.         Proof that guns don't make you safer is that if you buy one the government will show up and kill you?

'Nuff Said. Fourth Amendment: 1) The right of the BD's to be ""secure in their persons, houses, papers, and    effects against unreasonable searches and seizures"" was violated by: 	a> Initial baseless assault Fifth Amendment: 1) The Davidians were ""held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous    crime"" without a ""presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury."" 2) The Davidians were ""deprived of life, liberty, and property without due     process of law.

Eighth Amendment: 1) The Davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when: 	a> The FBI cut off the water to the ranch 	b> The FBI used Psy-War (loudspeakers broacasting the screams of 	   dying rabbits and Tibetian Chants) 	c> The FBI prevented family members from contacting their family 	   inside the ranch. 	d> The FBI used tear-gas against them (especially the children) 	e> The FBI burned the ranch down. 	f> Thoes who escaped were imprisoned without bail without a hearing.

Haven't you ever stopped to wonder WHY the government raided this farm? This raid was NOT ABOUT RELIGION, SEX, OR CHILD ABUSE.  To the best available evidence at the moment, this raid, psychological torture, and group death was  about Koresh's failure to PAY A $200 TAX on ONE grenade launcher that he may  or may not even have had!  That's why it was the BATF doing the raiding in the first place.

Unless it's doing something that directly hurts someone else, what's the point?  (Otherwise, you'd better stop operating all motor vehicles, since the price of operating them *greatly* exceeds the cost in lives of firearms. WEll, it's been done at least twice.  South (North?)

Suffice it to say that I disagree both with the interpretation of ""well-regulated"" in the Second Amendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control, and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which ""well regulated"" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and not under control/disciplined, etc. Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not an 'arming everyone' clause.

"talk.politics.guns",54905,"But this is all gun control laws end up doing.  Politicians can never manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally. Karen McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION licensed gun owners in Massachusetts.  In the past year, the number of licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX. Yet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year. Does passing laws that will further restricting only those people ALREADY obeying laws pay any dividents? So far, I've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators. See, this is what I call the ""argument from religion:"" ""I believe.""  Don't believe -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith.  Go look at the history of countries that passed gun restrictions.  Pay particular attention to whether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER after.  (Don't look at ""violent gun crimes,"" that's begging the question.) You may be very surprised. You have this absolutely backwards.  If crime stopped in the presence of strict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it. However, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent  crime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted.  Think about it. So far, none of the stats show any improvement... Do you really think driver's tests are any indication of your propensity for having accidents?   I've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while  drunk; after having been up all night; with two fighting kids in the  back seat; with a hot cup of coffee on their lap; or while putting on  makeup, reading the newspaper, or talking on their cellular phone.   But that's what they're doing when they have those accidents. How can anything that has no positive effect at all ever be ""necessary?"" And it didn't help, any of it.

"talk.politics.guns",54913,"If in said situation. I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported on in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action is as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a  weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!) and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile  action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!) Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's  ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's practicality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45) IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER WILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not bother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a Bystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!) call the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on  the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special purpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the Glaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court. (ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not  ricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often cross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with one shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court. Be as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were. Repeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see if your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your  politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are required in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one, contact the NRA.

"talk.politics.guns",54950,"NO SURRENDER! Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993 It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The stranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The mugger...the rapist.  And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and always, there's the implied question ""what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you? But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10 years to devote learning judo? What if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that ""rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any other form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for robbery/assault)(Kleck,123)  What if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the whole community. As a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice themselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves? Here's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says ""no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out."" But if a woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient means possible, people - especially other women - are horrified. ""Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!"" they ask. How could you hurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from you. In truth, 1% of ""defensive gun uses"" result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck) Well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already made that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more guns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching others, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense. We're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT. But there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more secretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist. That menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that governments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed people. It's the way they survive. In our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and threatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides ""it's for your own safety"" or ""we know best"". Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender. But this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who should be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt me? Then why did you file your income tax?  Like any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's really after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're after me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff, Metzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for our assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition.  As citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices given to women: to surrender or to fight.  Surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the disappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender.  A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if they have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson: ""the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots."" As a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will do my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write, and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it can lead to Tiananmen Square.  When the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future, I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick.  My opinions are, of course, my own."

I'm not sure if they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave. Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said are true.

Twist.     CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily     crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally,     including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is     applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and     staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is     primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the     rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement.     Phoenix will be the home for this national organization.     The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun     control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek     reasonable regulation of firearms.     But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear     need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac-     countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.     When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime-     Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars     to getting criminals off the street.

And your Family?  3.	You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears suddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you strong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape you in order to survive the attack?  If the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep and bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to defend yourself and your family?  Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If certain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law enforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition for use in your handgun.  There is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened? Our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time, or in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while waiting for help to arrive.  There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit the sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One elected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment!  I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected officials decided that they should only belong to a ""certain church"", or go to church on a ""partiular day""?  What if you were told that you could only read certain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the right to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful manner?  These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments. If we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight for the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your life is affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by defending your Second Amendment rights. "

"talk.politics.guns",55050,"	Very narrow.  Very, very narrow.  If you'll recall, I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations.  How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what isn't is only the start of this. 	And you've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors blow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See what a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the PRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor itself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is flawed in a few respects already. 	Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If you don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus.  Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits this definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild. 	And I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example, perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can be used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that it can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance. So, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I still have those pesky gophers. 	The basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good. 	It is under your proposed law.  So is a silage pit if there is run-off.  So are underground fuel tanks. 	It meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that can be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose, and despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass destruction is rather a given. 	It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not see a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for abuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to, generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse. < Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > <  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

"talk.politics.guns",55053,"This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list: I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said... Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid. Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to people like Koresh. Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US. There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas. Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force). ""All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power."" The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores. Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in chains. The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for review. Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had some medical personnel on hand. He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns back.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner. The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and they reacted accordingly. With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable, then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was the first shot fired! The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the public's sympathy. Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous, diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized, well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have even more tragic results.    - Lyn Bates      (bates@bbn.com) PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston College Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or place, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that information."

Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides, the ranch house (not ""fort apocalypse""; it was just a house despite what the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The ""Gun loonies"" couldn't hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames. The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well* under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't even tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that the FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve. Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life. Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American people will probably believe them. This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns *and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On the other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound. But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons hasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke any laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified. The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol violations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO. Sounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are ""heavily-armed religious wackos"". David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out peacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud. Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions of committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this. Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the Waco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die. You're wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They had MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous. Gun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.

"talk.politics.guns",55074,"If we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is ""just"" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't have direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968 8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after exposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I doubt whether I could find the exit. Indeed, I can't imagine living through it."

"talk.politics.guns",55076,"When did Koresh go on a rampage? What I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th. Probably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion to anything reasonable. And yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled believe the government forces acted appropriately.  They don`t believe Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack. I suppose they also believed things like: ""I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget."" ""We don`t need to lead with a tax increase...."" ""It starts with a middle-class tax cut..."" ""I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history."" ""I will ask congress for a line item veto.."" ""I will lift the social security earnings test.."" I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves right, rather than the other way around.  That way I have a better than 50% chance of being right about my first guess! Read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens and their rights.  I am sick of the abuse of government power.

"talk.politics.guns",55077,"there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents.  Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under.  I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents. What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths? I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.  My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.  Overall, I thought that I had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were useful.  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence or the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between 1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the ""statistics"".  Okay, maybe I worded it wrong...DAD.  I meant that to put children in a situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the act of a Messiah in my opinion.  I'm not saying that Koresh had control over these children directly, but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is would not let innocent children die. If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such, why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive?

No longer is it government of the people by the people, its government of the people by the biggest guns.  The idea of 'sorting it out in court later' is fine, but one has to GET TO COURT IN ONE PIECE to do that.  Korash had good reason to think that he was not going to get that chance.

He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was being ATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh, its ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at that point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear of his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have you ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think, under that pressure, when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate what is going on?  And, it would not be the first time that 'law enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  For all we know, he was informed by someone saying something like ""Hey, guy, the BATF is coming like gangbusters, and they mean to WASTE you..."" According to the latest news, the released warrant (so we are told) said the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around $200,000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period). Now, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a drug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priced decent guns lately?).  Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is an avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal, nor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what is the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad for some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?

But it all turned to shit, and the FBI taking over to manage things, we see it all turned to shit, too.  Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility'...  BAH. Responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong.  Bet you NOBODY pays any serious repercussions.

"talk.politics.guns",55101,"True. No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder. Two  years ago this month my house and office burned.  In my office was my reloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was  about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20 and .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the  reloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2"" of char on the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other words. None of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited. No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do. The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids completely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away. Many of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood on all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were found still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into  the wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually dislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets. The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.

You assume that anyone who doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and therefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the government says is wrong to be wrong. David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists, methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment. You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others fit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned  from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.

Think (if you're capable) for a moment about some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if suddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are beneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear enough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically designed to force you to make that ""forsake or die"" decision? The ""forsake or die"" option is exactly what the government forced on the Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that first shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51 when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The people who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those people go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.

"talk.politics.guns",55104,"No firearms were ever ever shot at the National Guard at Kent State. At the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all.  The squad was slowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students were taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two students who were following and taunting. The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while occasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from. All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1 Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this 45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with the taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in the confrontation. There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently they had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had conveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio, James Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known that he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in. The matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the terms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not identified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified). It was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently by General DelCorso or any of his command.

It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out. Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this so-called ""explosion"" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited. We figure that this is what it was because of how the ""explosion"" looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT, dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day. Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide? Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS. What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets, or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to make sure that others ""find"" what they want for them to ""find"" if you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades. Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

"talk.politics.guns",55121,"Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to  understand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ? BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no propaganda value there.  The FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the BDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan.  The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on the BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the BDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like the rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have obtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to do. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies to themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest of us - at the voting booth.  If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have become that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to vote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years, we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is raiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand. When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the public doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out of shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow. Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious fanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't blame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within the parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'."

[his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people to carry concealed in Illinois] I did read the law before I commented on it.  Judging from replies I received about my ""Semantics on t.p.g"" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or business. Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore.

"talk.politics.guns",55248,"Unlikely.  Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not propel the bullet with any significant velocity. In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded cartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough to take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe. Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.                                -- Alane --   /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    ""I am a jelly doughnut""      \  /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \"
"talk.politics.guns",55249,"As David Veal points out, this sort of ""promotion"" would be used against gun owners by the mass media. However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area, free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40 or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion. Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but feel they should know something about ""gun safety"" since members of their family keep guns at home. Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits: (1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases     firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats. (2) A ""gun safety"" class is Politically Correct, and likely to     be viewed positively by the public and the media. (3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)     and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a     gentle introduction to firearms. (4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun     and become more involved in shooting or personal defense. (5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners     in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,     non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate     the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun     students sometimes tell us they have ""something new to think     about"" with regards to personal gun ownership. (6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun. Our course is the standard NRA-certified ""Home Firearm Safety"" class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also teach the NRA's ""Personal Protection"" class, although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time. I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs.                                -- Alane --   /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    ""I am a jelly doughnut""      \  /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \"

The ATF is not in charge of investigating child abuse. In obvious contradiction to the statements made by the F. B. I. And just what are those actions that you are judging them by?

I hope you'll respond, and I seem to be a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail, so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to make a few points here. 	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting the many?  We say ""no,"" while others say ""yes."" 	Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it. 	Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention is how much one has to pay. 	It is this ""giving a little"" that makes Americans wary... We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a Chamberlain ""gave a little"" to a particular fascist/short asshole, and how such ""appeasement"" worked.  While it might work in some instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure. 	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus, cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns.  How one defines ""essential"" often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed. 	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace. Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony. One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action. 	It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have wound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that ""or"" was so logical. 	That was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out how we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different backgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage. 	BATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  Child abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities. 	That hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites.  Most people do not get it for this reason, and I suspect money, not censorship, is the main reason.  Do you get alt.sex* at your site?

But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, ""Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990"" Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state that ""Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded"". Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say ""Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990."" Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state that ""Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from 1986 to 1988."" Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion.  I really don't want to do that.  Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC. They don't just study cancer and heart disease.  I've got news for you, interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents. WHO THE F**K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE FIREARM CHARLES??? In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump into a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1 sentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here??? You're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn't. Charles buddy, I'm getting really tired of this.  Do you live on the planet Mars???  As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot, whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and whether they themselves have ever been shot.

The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to your belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another Deir Yassin.

"talk.politics.mideast",76368,"Nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this.  It does not appear in several long published accounts by Irgun participants.

It seems the Begin overruled this plan, however the willingness of many of the attackers to seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive character evidence. The Haganah tried to get the Irgun to attack a village with real military significance, but it was considered too hard.   The soft target of Deir Yassin was chosen instead. There was intention (probably originating with Begin) to give such a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before reaching the village.  Everyone knows that.

"talk.politics.mideast",76403,"	   Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism    during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -    off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of    Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of    terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the    Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British    soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in    favor of a compromise with the Palestinians. The Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted fogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families or such (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were killed sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs. In case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried to justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.    In addition, they    massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing    to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their    very lives. Yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I wasn't there and don't have reffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away, most of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to be fighters being killed. Those ""massaceres"" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not hounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period. 	   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part    Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the    Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the    Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the    Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for    German and European anti semitism. What do you mean ""screwed over by the Jews""?  They began the '47 war and didn't accept the arrgenment planned by the U.N.,  what did you expect the Jews to do??

The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,    spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin    shepherds from roaming.    A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.    But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these    Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure    was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields    in order that the land could be transferred to the army. And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:    No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held    today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of    the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized    by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now    confined to seven ""development towns"", or *sowetos*, established    for them.    (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:    elias@ismennt.is) So what you basically say is that ""we know for sure that nothing good happens there now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived and that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows about what the Jews did there."" Is that what you said?  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote? BTW,  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis.  Not to mention that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full brigade of them."

Dec. 1989    Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,    launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth    Council meeting in North London, last week.    The diaspora, he claimed, ""was the cancer connected to the main    tissue of the Jewish people"". He was scathing about its failure to    act before the Holocaust.

"talk.politics.mideast",76432,"   This is such Bullshit.  Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on    the part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my    opinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the    Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this    agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might    grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but    nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that    this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin    MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the    Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to    your belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later    advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was    useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians    were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another    Deir Yassin.   	   I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;    atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.    Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are    and were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jew    suck equally. rj3s, you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance. In fact, Begin, who was in charge of the Irgun, wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for its military significance. Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation. People died. But the thing was never intended to be a masacre. That this hapenned is a tragedy of war - not a crime of the Irgun. Harry."

Amendment I                                           (1791) 	   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 	   religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or 	   abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the 	   right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition 	   the government for a redress of grievances.    Steve I do not say that freedom of speech should be banned. Far from it. I am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be universally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many such things. But there are some. As an example: (1) murder is morally incorrect (2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to another is morally incorrect etc. The point is that any action which serves to promote a morally incorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the right to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of freedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the murder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a morally incorrect action. In the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow definition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has the right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by the first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as the right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated against. I believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a terrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything short of such an effort would render us little more than trained monkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in question.

"talk.politics.mideast",76461,"Found this in soc.culture.pakistan Might be of interest..... am posting it without the permission of the original poster. Hope he/she doesnt mind. By Lance Gay, Scripps-Howard News Service SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust. Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says he and about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leave for Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district running. Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of  Jews living in Sarajevo. ``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping  people alive,'' Ceresnjes said. As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and  had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war erupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began stockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees. They were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the shooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia- Herzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals. The center, which has been shelled several times along with most of Sarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world. While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here say there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to centuries of Turkish occupation. Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman Catholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before World War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were hidden by Muslim families in Mostar."

The fact that ""Israel did much more shelling"" was in response to Palestinian shelling from Lebanon. Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese territory. Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah, PLO, FPLP etc. as long as its northern border is not quiet. If the Lebanese army can control these  elements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border. I remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to  work. As for the election of Bashir Gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to Israel, is that why the Syrians killed him? His brother Amin was a Syrian  puppet, if he had not been, he would have been dead by now. Tsiel"
"talk.politics.mideast",76463,"[TC] Do you, as I do, agree that this (sort) of ""peace process"" is needed? [TC] What about the particular points mentioned in the article? Is what [TC] Israel is (supposedly) going to propose ""good""? Does it go too far? [TC] Not far enough? [TC] If you don't agree that a ""peace process"" is needed, what is? I personally think that a peace process is needed, since only through negotiations will the future generations be able to live in stability. Unfortunately not all think like this, we have cases like: 	Anas Omran, Hamza Saleh, Jle, Mohammed Reza, Mehmed Abu-Abed,  Anwar Mohammed and others who think that JIHAD is the only solution.  I wish that people (including myself) would have more objective views like Tim, Basil and Shai for example and put the rhetoric aside and start discussing ""substance"". My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the opposite. What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed? What have the Palestinians proposed? If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their  charter, or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good start. The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are plagued by internal strife, that is why we are not getting anywhere. Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only vow for the destruction of Israel. Arabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table, got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation between the two countries.  The tougher you play ball with Israel the tougher Israel gets. Tsiel Tsiel"

Furthermore, you even deny the  obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of  the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be  studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the  horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians and their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic  homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied  by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up  the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory  to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime  of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making  reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

The Jews,   because of their close association with the Ottoman administration,   were massacred along with the Turks. The Jewish communities of Mistras,   Tripolis, and Kalamata were decimated; the few survivors moved north to   settle in Chalkis and Volos, still under Ottoman rule.

This was the age of   nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with   the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on   the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul   and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be   the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement,   provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the   efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the   other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so   much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which   dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious   independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the   Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent   aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>   page 188:   <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their    campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular    representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian    missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and    hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as    ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.    Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,    soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews    and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.    Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving    large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,    by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects    who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim    support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent    nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive    and damaging.    The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting    nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian    states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout    the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary    in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>   page 188:   <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,    their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and    massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking    boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which    had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries    earlier.    This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth    century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united    Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth    century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its    Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When    Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian    principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre    of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>   page 189:   <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the   Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from   Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and   plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through   Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>   page 190 (second paragraph):   <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population    was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal    property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews    who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to    compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>   page 190 (third paragraph):   <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly    because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist    movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia    during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by    the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During    the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred    in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about    twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were    massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,    after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled    with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac    and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the    Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the    city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial    superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of    Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of    Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].    The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled    from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity    under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into    rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before    it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression    and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities    to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years    of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the    mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the    Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately    fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary    accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying    exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of    the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats    to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman    Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,    particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the    Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their    populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th    century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews    who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu    and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands    more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and    Izmir [21].>>    page 193 (last paragraph):    <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing    protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe    stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all    the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being    used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as    for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and    professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian    millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,    Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the    Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally    atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their    homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors    fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements    subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done    in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the    twentieth century.>>   page 194 (last paragraph):   <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the    Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the    Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due    to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of    those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a    popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of    the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,    thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms    in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods    of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from    persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.    The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian    forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,    and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,    homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus    toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically    described the situation caused by the invading armies:       'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,       all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never       destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the       entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can       never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the       damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done       to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government       weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors       inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The       consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of       them were massacred in a single night....'[28]      'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and       burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high       civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of       6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by       flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and       without even anything to wear is in despair. Everyone wants to       emigrate...'[29]   page 196:     <<As a result of these assaults, massacres, and forced deportations from    the independent countries of Southeastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire    received literally thousands of Jewish refugees who joined the Muslims    who survived the persecution, flooding into the Empire...>> [14] Shlomo Rozanes, Korot Hayehudim Beturkiyah Vebeartzot Hakedem:     Hadorot Haachronim (Jerusalem, 1945), pp.42-44, cited Yitzchak Kerem,     'The Influence of Anti-Semitism on Jewish Immigration Patterns from     Greece to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th Century', pp.2, 14.

During the course of evening I asked   Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and   the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes,   I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of   those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.""  p. 202 (first and second paragraphs). ""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as   ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work   of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.   Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead.""  p. 15 (second paragraph). ""The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages   and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of   their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley   to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following   the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt   desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains.   Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized."" ""I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while   holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and  treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all  Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving  a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified  an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility."" p. 20 (second paragraph). ""Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar  section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors  were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great   fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they  smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last  Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,  unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and  the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished."" p. 109 (second paragraph). ""As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative  experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself  incompetent to rule by legitimate means.  The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and  outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing  body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to   do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their   fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.  The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,  as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking  the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and  condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method   of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the  condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back  of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of  those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became  a common way of paying debts."" p. 203 (first paragraph). ""A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the  point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock   and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him  sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising  it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!  Slodkey!' (Sweet.)"" p. 203 (second paragraph). ""One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the   ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about  it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.  The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed  sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and  other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the  dead."" p. 204 (first paragraph). ""I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of  a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make  my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy  that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of  a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a  Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her  throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a  year old."" p. 118. ""Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart  jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging  them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the  carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.  Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they  sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.  Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading  oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians   concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and  scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.  This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by   barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....  That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted  and completely destroyed."" p. 192.

I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,  in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless  and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the  heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,  and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with  their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself."" p. 133 (first paragraph) ""In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who  had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians  abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of  these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the  brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,  mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method  employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after  crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw."" p. 19 (first paragraph) ""The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of  ruins.

There are *lots* of military targets in Israel.  There are lots of legitamate targets in Israel.  Old ladies, children, and civilians in general are not acceptable targets. 	If the only person you can kill is a civilian, you hold your fire.  If that means you can't kill anyone, then you can't kill anyone.  Claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they are easy kills is rediculous. 	Did they make a policy of it? 	Did you mean excuse? :)  Killing a soldier and killing a civilian are two very different acts. 	No, they killed soldiers so that the British government would leave.  The objective was not to scare civilains, but show that the cost of staying was way too high.   	In contrast, a terrorist kills civilains to scare other civilains.  They use random violence against people to make a point that no one is safe until their demands are met.  An analogy would be the Irgun blowing up Harrods or 10 Downing. 	Thats because you missed the essential point of arab terrorism, which is to scare civilains away from Israel, by killing those who have something to do with Israel.  It is to kill Jews because they might be Zionists.  It is to kill people who live in Israel because of where they live.  The targets are rarely soldiers, or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of duty, but innocent civilians, to underscore the message that no one who deals with Israel is safe. 	Oh, you mean you favor the Israelis, outnumbered 2 to 1, outgunned, surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a peace treaty in 45 years?

I think that Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I am not sure. Someone else around here will know for sure. There are claims that Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the Jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda.

Also, I do on rare occaisons, read Arab papers, but its hard to find English language papers from Arab countries here. 	Have I ever claimed to be objective?

"talk.politics.mideast",76475,"	I have to say I think this is the first time there has been something posted that opposed me without making personal insults. Congradulations tim. I think the other people answered you on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal conflicts policy).  	Israel very often gets away with more than most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am not familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the pilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly in favor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) and against ""Outlaw"" countries like iran and more recently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel for things they do ""wrong"". Again the reason some condemnations don't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation resulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved another case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including in Israel and the occupied territories). 	Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults."

"talk.politics.mideast",76519,"(Re: the newsgroup -- followups set to talk.politics.mideast where this belongs.) This may make the term 'civil war' dubious, but it does nothing to the phrase 'destroy the government'. An occupying government is still a govern- ment, and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don't con- fer citizenship (which is your own determination of the distinction) but to wipe it out entirely (and, not incidentally, the entire Jewish population it rules with it). This is an intent to 'destroy the government', no matter where the government happens to be from. Wasn't a requirement for democracy in Athens. For that matter, isn't a requirement for the term democracy in the United States, which doesn't let non-citizens vote either. Both the United States and Israel have processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship, with a great deal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it's just that it isn't automatic for living in the territories. It isn't automatic for living in New York, either. That said, suit yourself. Having never considered democracy the ultimate in Good In This World, I could care less if you feel like calling Israel, or America, or anywhere else, a democracy. Personally, I withhold the term from Israel for the same reason I withhold it from Britain... the parliamentary system is a serious handicap. Again, suit yourself. In which case Israel is *not* attacking its own people, it is fighting a war on foreign soil, in which case the residents are entitled to play rough, yes -- but Israel's allowed to get just as rough, within the bare limits of the rules of war. This includes, among other things, the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun- try in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault on all rock-throwers), along with the right to take out any installation of military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications can be handled by aerial bombing, as can waterways since they count as supply lines to the enemy), and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever constitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if Hamas is trying to set up as the ruling party, let them beware).  If this is not the scenario you want, I recommend you go back to calling it a civil war. Civil wars have to be handled nicer. You cannot say the Palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign nation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people cruelly. If the Palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country, so is Israel, and the gloves come *off*. 	-Naomi"

"talk.politics.mideast",76539,"%By Elias Davidsson - April 1991 (Revision Oct. 1991) Note - you are already posting ""facts"", some of which are outdated. The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a ""meeting of the minds"".  It is to those who read with open mind, that I address myself. %The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of %Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the %United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member %states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial %discrimination as ""any distinction, exclusion, restriction or %preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic %origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing %the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of %human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, %social, cultural or any other field of public life."" While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals, as the text currently stands I know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found. It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation. %The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining %Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The %important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since %it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli %racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of %Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United %Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial %practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy. If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited. Scarey thought. %The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of %the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native %non-Jews born in that country.  Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not alienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent.  This slant permeates the text. %Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas %under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most %of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the %author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians. The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups. Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group]. %Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim %was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant %opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population). If I recall correctly, at the time ""zionism"" took off, there was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any factual contradictory evidence . %But the %Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and %technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the %area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native %Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and %razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could %finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000 %non-Jews remained on Israeli territory. Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on ""most of their villages""? %Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to %help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their %political repression and their destitution. There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was that this was not the case. You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this.  As you do again, below. %In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied %the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus %another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its %occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered %illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security %Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and %began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these %territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time. Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions, though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them. Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions. %Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, %have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of %international law and UN resolutions. Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship, what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country previously (other than Iraq) ? %It must be emphasized that, although these people live under %different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as %Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a %territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity). Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an ""ethnic or racial"" basis.  Therefore your above statement is incorrect. I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination, the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically. However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period! %Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a %symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that %represents them in world affairs. Once again, some do, some don't. %The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab %territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant %discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation. Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you espouse. %licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the %right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject %to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be %challenged in court. Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal. Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some are, but this is not due to the ""whims"" of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization. %Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied %territories are permitted to carry firearms. Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in Daheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly. %Jewish settlers have %right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents %of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel %governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in %total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will %of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates %land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish %settlement. That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this. %Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them %consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For %many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected %to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by %the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish %settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and %humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to %vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in %practice. Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in, right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but as a result of what actions? %Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the %Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are %second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on %such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these %policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied %residence and membership rights in most rural communities in %Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews %are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government %starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of %funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos; %Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their %non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and %understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian %children are denied the right to learn their history and %literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end %of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the %authorities. 1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.     It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no     legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish     collective. 2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind     that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has     never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large     bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case      in point. 3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation     with regard to educational material.  You have obviously     never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.     It is based upon Jordan's school system. 4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another     gross generalization.   %The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of %all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never %openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the %country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its %ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards %non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is %made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs %into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately %17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen %of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of  %ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme %Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in %Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the %Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew. Another generalization, but lets not stop here. The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't, Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items, I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered previously. %Although sexual %relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal, %they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal %of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system %nurtures this attitude in a systematic way. When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true, nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one. %Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on %equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has %not produced any written Constitution.  Simply incorrect. The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your contentions to the sidelines. %Zionism predicates a state %where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law, %a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak %Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli %citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be %Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial %discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only %reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the %very nature of Israel as a Jewish state. But the discrimination is not based upon race. Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths. %Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that %does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel - %that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed %to fail. Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail. Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate shall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the amount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00."

"talk.politics.mideast",76545,"I agree with you Harry, however you must also concede then that Arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war.  remember that the Palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in order to further their cause.  If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective, I'm sure they would have done so.  I also don't exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism. The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued presence in Palestine.  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me, and not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not also forget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely] killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or who cooperated with the British.

On that we agree at least. Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed. This is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report on the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report. The Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour Government. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either. Perhaps you might want to tell me why?

"talk.politics.mideast",77180,"I do not want to convince anyone. This is just USENET, not the real world. I just read the opinions others have about a subject, and sometimes I present my opinion. I think that this net is only useful to exchange ideas. I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of anything. First, and I repeat it, I never said that the idea of Jews having the right to have a State is racist. Zionism, as a movement, is more than just that idea. I think that Zionism in the way it defines who is a Jew, for example, is racist-like. In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do not support the bombing and killing of the IRA, I believe that Jews have a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now. That is what makes the basis for Zionist movements. However, I am not  considering just that, but the rest of it.  Which makes an interesting point. People living in a Jewish State have shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are not the same. So, the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown  us that there are some problems in a State where 80% of the people is secular but Judaism is define according to religious standards, or where marriage is a religious stage, or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to a religious standard. Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become  non-Jews? Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a  religious definition? According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Inc, Publishers, Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A., 1986, page 593,  hy-poc-ri-sy: A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not. So, saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people  having the right to nationalism, but disregarding the right of the Palestinian people to do the same, according to this dictionary, is hypocrisy. I know what my words mean. I do stand by what I said I believe: Zionism is a form of racism. Of course, I tend to talk about things as they are and not as they are defined in a broad sense. AAP"

Travelling on this little ""war-time"" railway was indeed an experience, and it was necessary to carry a ""gauge,"" and to test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re- quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim- ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts whilst we passed over them. Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog- ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day, 60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the frontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val- ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin, some 15 miles from the main valley. Soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track.

"talk.politics.mideast",77185,"I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3) something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be. Namely, that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to  establish a police force for Haiti. I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it, nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved in internal conflicts. That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse lot - the UN (Security Council). And while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in most articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship under the UN Sec. Council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press and then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a ""civilized""  country that they have left behind.

"talk.politics.mideast",77186,"As I said, I do not want to convice anyone, so, why should my opinions convince anyone? I do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts. Maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here. One thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary, and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time. OK. Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a  different way, and how many are who define Jew based on a religious way. You need to start reading before answering.  My point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic, it  does not mean that I consider it to be nationalistic. I did not comapre Israel to the IRA. I think that you are starting to put words on my  mouth and that is wrong. I never said that Zionism is monolithic. If you are going to attribute me things, present the quotes where I said that. That is your problem. I could certainly interpret this like you are  running out of arguments. First, you put words in my mouth, now, you say you do ot believe me. Why don't you try reading for a change? Did I say that the Law of Return demand a person to be religious? Now, how does the Law of Return define  who is a Jew and who is not? I said that it uses a religious standard: If your mother is a Jew, you are a Jew, if your mother is not Jewish, neither you are. Do not twist my words, please. I am not talking about the debate. I am talking about how things are right now. When the debate is over, I'll see what happens. Right now, things are like they are. Let me ask you one thing. I understand that Israel differenciates between Citizenship and Nationality. Suppose M(ale) and F(emale) have a child in Israel. Which nationality will the child's ID show, according to each one of the following cases: a) F and M are both Jewish. b) F is Jewsh and M is not. c) F is Muslim and M is jewish. d) F is Christian and M is Jewish. e) F and M are both non-Jewish. It called history. At some point it was OK. Now, I believe, it is not.  Interesting. How do you know? Had I ever talked to you about this and  forgotten about that? Which definition are you now talking here about?  I do not know why you are so touchy. I never said that you did not support Palestinian self-determination. I just gave an example of hypocrisy. I never said that someone in this net is guilty of it. It was just an example. Nothing more, nothing less than that. Why did you have to clarify what you think? Here you have several problems. First, you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the dictionary. Second, it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more words than those in the dictionary. Third, we can exchange ideas if you want, but you come out with this nonsense about being believable = using the definitions given in a dictionary. It seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting others. Sad. If you did not put words in my mouth, it might be that you might start reading what I had actually said. So far, you come over and over twisting what I said or presenting things I never said as if I had said them. In this way, you are answering to yourself. That is why you do not find it believable. Maybe, if you start reading what I had actually said, and not what you added, you might change your mind. First, there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what I said, as if I had said it.  Seconf, anyone else is supposed to mean ""than I do""? AAp"

"talk.politics.mideast",77192,"OK. Lets look into this. According to my dictionary, Zi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel. Now, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious  principles, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural identities. So. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point is what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually doing. 1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of Return, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my family was expelled about 2000 years ago? 2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show? 3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been  expelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I  apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I  apply as someone whose mother is Jewish? 4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)? 5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation? 6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in Israel, how do I do it? 7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to Israel, to convert to Islam? Now, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country do not care about politics. They just want to be left alone. Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place  which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place. Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the fighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among  people he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same god. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country.  And, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created where my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel. And, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and granted full-citizenship. Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as 20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000 years? Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant. I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in  Zionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew. How would those who are Zionist define a Jew?  AAP"

"talk.politics.mideast",77195,"Then you haven't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against them. They have been, over and over again.  They will be again. Hey, what do you think dictionaries are for?  You quite obviously need one.  A good dictionary gives both, and you well know it. I don't think that data exist on this directly. That is no problem.  But once again you are defining Zionism as *ONE* movement.  You are implying that it is monolithic.  You *KNOW* this is not and has never been the case. You don't say it directly.  You implied it, and I showed explicitly where and how you implied it.  Now you're trying to wriggle out of it. Won't wash, and you know it. It's you, not me, who is running out of arguments.   What you said is that ""Judaism is defined according to religious standards.""  Now this can have several different meanings, and you know it.  One of the meanings that it can have is to say that ""Only those who are religious are defined as Jews"".  Another is to say that ""Only those who meet the religious definition of a Jew is one.""  And there are others.  I'm not twisting your words.  I'm trying to make you aware that your words don't mean what you think they do. Actually, it doesn't.  And the citizens' rights are exactly THE SAME in both cases, anyway. Jewish Jewish It'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house.  The original law of return would still admit such a person if they were Jewish, if memory serves. Not Jewish. That's valid, as far as I can see. More than once.  As have others. The very one you give above.  It is absolutely inconsistent with the twist you put on it.   No you didn't.  You had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees in order to do so, and everyone else knows it.  I'm not being touchy. Because what you gave *WAS NOT* an example.  IT WAS an example of how the definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees.   Oh, so now what are dictionaries for? Duh.  As a scientist, whose technical terms are very often not found in common dictionaries, I know this.  But when a term is common, like hypocrisy, a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source. It's not nonsense.  When people read what you write, they have to try to associate a meaning to those words.  Dictionaries give the meanings of words, don't they?  Now, I assume that you'd like to have the words you use mean what you'd like them to.  But the fact is, you're using very different meanings than are in the dictionary, or you would like the reader to assign them new meanings, which they never had.   Not at all.  What I cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been proven completely wrong. I never put even one syllable in your mouth.  You have tried to prove this and you failed.   Poppycock. I read what you said.  I did not add anything.  You simply either don't know that the words don't mean what you'd like them to - which cannot be the case now since you've been proven wrong and you quite obviously don't have a defense against the arguments presented, or you're twisting the meanings.  Which is it? Ha!  There's nothing resembling fact in what you've said.  I NEVER added *ANYTHING* to what you said."
"talk.politics.mideast",77196,"I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under the law of return.  By conversion, you've elected not to be a part of the Jewish nation. At the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world that *you* do not consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation.  So, why should the Jewish Nation consider you to be a member? No.  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to annihilate Israel, the Arabs have lost their claim to land there.

"talk.politics.mideast",77198,"So far, you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine. I would hardly take them as facts. I could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue (Spanish), that are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary. Even more, I could show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different from those in the dictionary. And guess why. Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define  in how many different ways the term Jew, which is the basis of the movement  itself? So, the evidence shows that up to now, Jew, when considered in terms of Israel, the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and not of cultural identity, even if 80% of those defined as Jews in Isreal are not religious. That IS a problem. I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is now. I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some might even had been inspired by noble ideals. Does that change the final results of what happened in the USSR? In the same way, even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous, it does not matter. What matters is the result. I never said it directly nor indirectly. I am not talking about individuals who defined themselves as zionists here. I am sure most of them are good, honest and caring people. I am talking about the results of the Zionist Movement. I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew, a country that defines nationality based on religion. I am talking about something I consider a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief.  After all, if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they  were not born in the ""right"" religion. I had never heard the definition: Only those who are religious are defined as Jews. I had always seen the definition: A person is a Jew is his/her mother is/was a Jew, and if such person does not convert, although I had seen people argue about the last part. So, there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel? Or what do you mean by ""Actually, it doesn't""? So, it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one. That is what I call a form of racism. You do not need to assume the representation of ""everybody else"" to  make your points. You should assume that you are just talking for yourself. About the other stuff, I still believe that the example was a valid one. It would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and then support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's right. It was an example. You are trying to justify something nobody has  talked about. Reference. yes, but not all of them. A language is something that evolves all the time. Not really. I posted in another post the definition of Zionism. And, in this post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the  begining. Zionism is a form of racism, even if most zionists are not racist in their individual and private lifes. A movement that ask for a State and National rights for a people, and then in practice, that people are defined according to religion is, for me, racist-like. You did it. Next time be more careful.

"talk.politics.mideast",77199,"Well, let's delve one level deeper. Why is democracy better than tribalism or other means of Govt.? The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping majority and booted out later, w/ no objections from the UN. Similarly, the people of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the junta declared it illegal. In both cases, I personally have _no_ problems with the outcome, but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the  world community claims to revere so, why isn't it interfering there?  Exactly. My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their problems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked  in the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left in 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well, look at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_ a success so long as the US was in, from what I remember. But it didn't last long, obviously. Nobody did. People should have a right to self-defense. If the UN wants to arm the Bosnians or Haitian revolutionaries or whoever, I have no problems with that. I do when they cross that line and attempt to re-arrange boundaries, govts. etc., the Vance-Owen plan being one such piece of insanity. We finally have a clearly-stated point of difference. Colonialism can have its good side, which is as you stated above - removing thugs from being able to lord it over powerless people. I am worried that the bad side is what  will assert itself, and I am prepared to let natural forces take their course  if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism."

Allegations of Jewish disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms than blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented. If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be given the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been documented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and shameful.

"talk.politics.mideast",77201,"Which was my point. By converting to another religion I do not loose my cultural identity, I just loose my religious identification. I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the  right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism. To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not by my religion. Actually, if I am an atheist, which is in fact like  converting into a non-Jewish in terms of religion, I am still considered as part of the Jewish Nation. I can be proud of my Jewish culture while not giving any importance to the Jewish religion. Or, even more, I can be proud of my Jewish culture while still be convinced that the real god is another one. I do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the American nation  because he changed of god. I still believe that we should never confusse the actions of States with the individuals who happen to live there. In the same way that I do not think it is right to blame all Israelis for the human rights violations of Israel, I do not think that we should assume that all Arabs are guilty of the actions of the Arab States. Some people fled their homes because they were scared. Now they are in there, still suffering for what they are not responsible. And, remember that we also were told the same at some point.

You even characterize it as ""an eye for an eye"".   You also wrote: so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque was razed.  You then followed it with: Really?  Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running amok with power with, say, the Iraqis?  Your ""eye for an eye"" comparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar with. This happened to be during a war!  And a fierce and mighty war it was, too.  Would you say that the Jordanians ""indiscriminately shot up ancient structures as is their custom"" in describing bullet holes in the walls of the city?  This was war!  It was certainly not any ""eye for an eye"" characterstic.  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings of revenge as the Arabs generally do.

There are postal and telephone directories from that time to prove it.

"talk.politics.mideast",77206,"Alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not have to believe in the ""religious"" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of Judaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily removing yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself Jewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of dissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most open nation.  We have no quotas! So I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion (not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism."

Igor and I had thought that if it was  a girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy,  we'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without Igor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother. Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew  up together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16.  In 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in  Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son, Seryozha, is four and a half. First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from  work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were  Komsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were  both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were  shouting, ""There's no room for Christians here!"" and ""When we finish with the  Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!"" And some even cried Out, ""Death to  the Armenians!"" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became  frightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen  downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich  Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he  returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was  smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I  was telling him everything, too, and he said, ""What, is there no longer any government?"" That same day Igor said, ""Papa, something terrible is happening  in the city."" And he said, ""We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our  own home."" The day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called  our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the  same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an  Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I  called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and  nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything. On February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were  afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I  told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't  be coming in. He agreed, and even said, ""Fine, don't come in, we understand  what's going on in town, don't come in."" Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my  father-in-law and said, ""Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are  happening in town."" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, ""With my own eyes I  saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know,"" he said, ""we  should leave town."" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we  should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together,  clothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the  building manager came by and said, ""Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is  bad, don't go out."" My father even opened up to him and said, ""Maybe we'll  drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there."" ""No,"" he said, ""it'll be worse  there, you'll be safer at home."" He said don't be afraid, if something happens  I'll send people to save you. After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our  courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two  children, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my  mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of  them, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, ""Go in that room and close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear that there's anyone home."" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my  brother-in-law's wife, suggested, ""Let's run out onto the balcony."" We -- the two daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out onto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said,  ""Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all."" We lived on the second floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At first we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time people were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I  pleaded and begged: ""Please, call someone, have someone come!"" I even started  shouting. ""I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them  and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive."" Either they  were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were  watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it  again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the  building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A  bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing over to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children  over there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet  seven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first;  you know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think,  and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and  crying. My Kristina said, ""Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're  afraid!"" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina  didn't even want to climb over. She shouted, ""I'm staying with Grandmother, I'm staying with Grandma!"" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And  my mother-in-law shouted, ""Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there,  save Kristina, too!"" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira  helped us and went back inside. We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist,  Sevil, open the door, open it, please!"" She didn't open it. ""No, go away, go  anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door."" She was our neighbor, we were  friends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we  were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and  said, ""Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll  kill us, too, because of you."" I begged, ""Please, at least take the children,  we'll leave, we'll go back."" ""No,"" she said, ""you have to leave."" Her sons ran  in, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: ""Get out  of here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!"" I became terrified, I took the  children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down  and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard ""The Armenians must be  killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!"" One of  them said, ""Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!"" When I  heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their  door for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any  longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay,  that they would save her. My head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next  entryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a  half. They were crying, ""Mamma, we're scared!"" They were so frightened that I  didn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was  awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, ""Open up, let  me inside!"" He opened the door slightly and said, ""No!"" ""No"" and that was it!  He said it so sternly: ""No!"" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists  on the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood  there, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get  down on my knees. ""Please, I beg of you, at least take the children."" He  wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me  inside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't  passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want  to open the door. And again I started pleading, ""Please, open the door, it's  our Ira and Lilia! Open the door!"" And he said, ""No, I'm afraid."" I said again  and again, ""Please, open the door, please!"" He looked at me. He looked at me  for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We  threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into  the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, ""Calm  the children, and calm yourselves down, too."" Calm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in  our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I  said, ""Igor, Edik, let's say farewell."" And Edik turned around and looked at  me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would  kill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They  started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that  he had told us, ""Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight."" He thought we  were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them:  ""Edik, Igor, let's say farewell."" Igor didn't think we could climb over to the  other balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were  able to save ourselves. Igor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All  the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next  to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from  the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: ""Open the door!"" We  were all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, ""They're home, they're in there, break down the door!"" And I remember my father-in-law  whispering, ""They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . "" He had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were  going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal  chair legs. From outside the door they said, ""We're counting to five, open  up!"" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was  home. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law  had said, ""It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be?  Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with  everyone."" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani  guest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there  often, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save  ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, ""I'm not  leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight  alongside them."" That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said,  ""If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight  alongside my family, I'm not going anywhere."" We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and  shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor  at the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's  voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a  long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: ""Open the  door, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's  her voice!"" But the Lezgin said, ""It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in  your apartment."" He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and  the Lezgin opened the door and said, ""Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran  away."" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him  outside, next to the building. While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The  way Ira shouted! She shouted, ""Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!""  She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many  people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling,  whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like. Apparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway  where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I  don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in particular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed  over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law  were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming  up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were  our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them.  They were sleeping. I woke them up: ""Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!"" And I tell  Ira: ""Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony."" We  were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door  too, because later he said, ""I opened the door and told them there were no  Armenians inside."" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the  balcony himself to see: they were gone. We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from  the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider  hiding us. The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said,  ""Karina, there're no lights on in our block."" The whole block was dark, the  whole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, ""I'm afraid to keep you until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving you."" I said, ""What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave with the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere else to hide."" He said, ""Well OK, go look."" I asked Ira, ""Ira, do you want to go?"" Ira said, ""No, I'll stay with the children, Karina."" I said, ""Fine, then I'll go."" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one  was in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at  after seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never  went out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the  boarding school and my director answered. He said, ""Karina, where are you?"" I didn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I  was. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what  time it was, I asked him, ""What time is it?"" He said 11:20, I think, but I  don't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I  look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there was the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse  for a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen  grabbed my hand and squeezed it: ""Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on,  what are you turning around for?"" I turned around and saw a large truck, it  must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck  like that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the  fourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police  then they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the  police station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, ""Soldier, in  Block 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to  save them!"" And he said, ""Go to the police station and tell them everything.""  I said, ""I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them."" He said, ""Don't be  afraid."" We went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military  vehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the  police station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that  they'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to them. After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us  to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they  took us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there,  very many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was  only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots,  nothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee. The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably  alive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of  Sumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came  and told us, ""Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party  Committee."" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for  six days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee  and waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira  had only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went  by. And then one of the functionaries told us, ""Karina, Ira, gather your  courage. Would you like to go to the burial?"" I said, ""What, did they really  kill all of them?!"" He said, ""Let's look."" He had a long list, and he started  reading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in- law, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law, and Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said,  ""Get in the car, let's go to the burial."" We buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive of it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my  children when they're older? My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, ""My grandma is  better than anyone!"" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's  difficult for her, and once she told her: ""You're a bad grandmother."" I don't know why, I asked her, ""Kristina, where's Papa?"" and she said, ""They  killed him."" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded Seryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, ""When Papa  comes I'm going to tell him everything!""

"talk.politics.mideast",77211,"I think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute racial discrimination. These criteria are to be found for example in the 1.  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial     Discrimination (ratified by most countries) 2.   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights 3.   The Human Rights Charter 4.   The European Convention of Human Rights If one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these legally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is obvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination. The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion by the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live under Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora. They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole reason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any provisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance. Israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of the State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It would facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east and constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence - in the area. Any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities, is fraught with genociadal implications. I hope that U.S. Jews, who sincerely wish that peace prevail in Israel/Palestine, will finally realize this fact.

"talk.politics.mideast",77213,"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Labour's enclaves policy.IMPORTANT Labour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories by Israel Shahak publ. in Middle East International, London, 30.4.93 It is not difficult to discover Israel's policy towards the  Palestinians at any given time. It can be easily inferred  from the facts on the ground and from the information  provided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition,  though. The torrents of claptrap about ""the peace  process"" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official  pronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality.  By concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent  that Labour's policies were no different from those of  Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their  more effective implementation. Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel  Sharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot  Aharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a  division of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip  into four, ""autonomous"" Palestinian enclaves, all of them  under Israeli supervision. The total area of these  enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the  territories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli  settlements and the highways built around the enclaves.  The entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of  Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already  been turned into a ""Greater Jerusalem"" where the Arab- inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded  by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for  them. Judging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be  assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number  of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had  planned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by  settlements strategically dispersed along the highways  remains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in  the West Bank: two in ""Samaria"" and two in ""Judea"" (i.e.  north and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more  than two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to ""Greater  Jerusalem"", Labour's policies hardly deviate from  Sharon's. A saner version of Likud policy As some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour  policies were but a saner version of Sharon's  extravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot  Aharonot that, while ""barely a few months ago"" Labour  supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond  the Green Line, ""no specific decision to freeze  construction in the territories has been taken"". And Uzi  Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that ""as far as can be judged  on the basis of the internal political discussions in  Jerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways"". The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are  located in ""Samaria"". Therefore the belt of settlements  around the ""Trans-Samaria Highway"", designed to  separate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount  importance. According to the latest data, the percentage  of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population  (apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But  for the area around the ""Trans-Samaria Highway"", the  corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is  increasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of  the ""Efrat Block"" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever  the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around  Hebron, is pretty much the same. The ""Efrat Block"" is now  being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway. The project is costly in the extreme, because the highway  is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long  tunnels. The final decision to build this highway was  suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in  March. The subsequent decision to renew its construction  can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a  whole. Process of impoverishment The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady  impoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known  in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be  concerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip,  the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in  Ha'aretz in March. He mentions having seen ""a pamphlet  issued six years ago by the Civil Administration  forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli  rule in 2000"". His analysis deserves to be quoted  extensively: ""We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its  quality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to  steal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found  there more and more settlements, as if we deliberately  want to make the inhabitants despair, and in their  despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is  by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now  spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time  as they spend working. From the military point of view,  we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's  area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and  resources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the  defence ministry, I heard him saying that we should  withdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument  was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and  deeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak  Shamir but he rejected it."" Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too. Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can  also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being  implemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by  the first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to  divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim  Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli  this enterprise is. ""The Qatif Block is now producing 40  per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a  substantial proportion of cut flowers."" He also deals with  the subsidies the settlers receive, considerably  augmented by the present government. Owing to them,  housing units are cheap. The present government does  not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block.  ""Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage  for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels  ($6,500)."" Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the  Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to  work in Israel. The economic motivations were explained  by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March: ""From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be  sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could  be barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate  data is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the  last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving  daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from  80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease  is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel  from Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of  demand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment  in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments  blocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no  longer really needed..."" Gaza's total dependence The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent  on Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has  been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli  factories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of  small workshops, employing an average of four workers,  get their raw materials or unfinished products, together  with detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories.  Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that  ""the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent  of that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the  average wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer  does not pay any social security for his employees."" If  the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that  in Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of  Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast. They are higher still when ""a Gazan sub-contractor  provides labour to be performed at home, with the  family's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of  Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work."" Many of  them are women and children, paid about ten shekels  ($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can  be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan  labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition  of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from  the Strip. Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from  what was created straight after Israel's conquest [in  1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the  talk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures  intended to ""encourage economic development in the  territories"", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits  for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval  by the Shin Bet. ""Behind all the professed goodwill there  is no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good  colonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the  natives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not  become rebellious, and never do anything against the  interests of the metropolis, its economic interests  included,"" wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The  development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip  accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis. Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work.  ""In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in  motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from  the threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is  simplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds  in persuading the government, or even the trade and  industry minister alone, a military order is issued  prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this  does not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a  licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse  its production."" Among the most active of such lobbies is  the agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports  of Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers)  not only to Israel but also to Europe, where they  otherwise might compete with Israeli exports. Perpetuaring apartheid Labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in  the territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which  otherwise could not support the Labour government so  firmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels  happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its  greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This  point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who  deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to  Likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly  settlement growth ""occured during the term of office of  the National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which  Rabin served throughout as the defence minister"".  Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than  Labour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements  without strategic value founded under Shamir for  symbolic reasons. To sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by  the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the  efficiency with which it is implemented. According to  that policy the territories are to be divided into two  parts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly,  and the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist  scheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying  price in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is  recognised, the less suffering it may cause."

AIRPORT     ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon     arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI     interrogation. By Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer San Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law enforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation League was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police said Friday. Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after the FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard was returning home. Gerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count each of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy. If convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and $40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police argued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000.  A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child, with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and ""wanted to have his day in court,"" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and one of two arresting officers. Gerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett said.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges. Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil rights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave criminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years. Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950 groups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents. Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney, James Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the interview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged snooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any criminal wrongdoing. Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling intelligence to South Africa. ADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal activity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest ""has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on the case."" Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying, according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to pursue the investigation. ""We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement,"" said James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington. Police, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A former police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home. ""I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but we didn't think it would happen this quickly,"" Capt. Willett said.  ""This development really speeds up our timetable on the case."" During his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence division.  His last assignment was on the gang task force. After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of Manila. Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines Airlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard after his six-month hiatus, police said. ""He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked look on his face,"" Willett said.  ""Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'"""
"talk.politics.mideast",77218,"Yedi'ot Ahronot, April 9, 1993.  Excerpt. EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO* (* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo, Shamir's Military Secretary.  Irrelevant to this excerpt.) By Nahum Barne'a In mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...].  A year and a half earlier, Khaled Sheikh Ali, 27, a member of the Islamic Jihad, died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison.  The two SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put on trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and sentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was the first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to prison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the director of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the effectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case were [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza. When they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators agreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed in charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the directors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter of the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture, but also ""the culture of lies"", which Judge Landau had described in his report of two years before, were still very much in existence.  Nothing had changed. The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among them the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system and Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not know.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with low ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the explanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered from his very high position to a less high position. [""The culture of lies"" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators' policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were tortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods -- thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those methods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to lie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking to the ""approved"" torture methods. -- Yigal]"

I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and    went inside.  The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an   iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black   with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As   the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face   up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what   was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,   as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

Then abruptly Dro broke into   laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense  of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.  From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last   scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,   looms, even spinning-wheels.  'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must   leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.'

Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,  but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust  of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on  Moslem villages."" p. 358. ""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three  sides. ""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. ""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror."" ""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked. ""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not."" ""But the women and children?"" ""Will fly with the others as best they may."" p. 360. ""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'  Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.  As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.  Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.  'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.  At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses.

She lay in some stubble   where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet   had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.  The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.   There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was   empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking   colonel.

The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.     Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and feared dead.     The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""

She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.     One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.     The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold.     By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.

I love people who don't read and then spout myths as evidence. Where were Greeks in 1912 and 1913? I guess, they were busy with...   Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica              Culminated in 1912 and 1913   <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.   Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>   <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.   Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>> [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920,  the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide,  tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against  the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and  deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

"talk.politics.mideast",77228,"Some articles on the topic:  RTw  12/23 0859  GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS   (Eds: updates with end of summit details, quotes)      By Youssef Azmeh      ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states, emerging from a summit that restored  their unity after almost three months of crisis, piled pressure on Iran on Wednesday to  reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island.      They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council summit saying Iran  had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding measures that ""rocked  Gulf stability and security.""      The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements by Egypt, which  engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia and Qatar that  allowed all members to attend the summit.      Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and Tehran's alleged  encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind President Hosni  Mubarak's mediation.      The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and  Iran ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its  commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and  territorial integrity of the region's states.""      It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it shares with the  United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and Lesser Tumbs  islands.      Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it  established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.      It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the  UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority over the whole  island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation.      The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the  Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general  settlement.      The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against Iraq for not fully  implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.      They endorsed once again the ""Damascus Declaration,"" a pact signed with Egypt and  Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove Iraqi troops out of  Kuwait.      But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a fund they  announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year which would have  helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme.      They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of contributions from each state  although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the $10 billion agreed  last year.      The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and  Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although their unity was only  maintained with outside help.      Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow progress of the  conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the region that boasts  the bulk of global oil and gas reserves.      The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals.      One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos to create a  100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member against external  aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.      Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man ""Peninsula  Shield"" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is commanded by a Saudi  general.      Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market although the summit  called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due to be held in  Saudi Arabia next December.   REUTER YA DYA DJG  RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT      ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day annual summit on  Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three strategic Gulf islands as  a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf.      A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the settlement of a  row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for continued U.N. sanctions  against Iraq.      It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council decisions following the  expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year.      The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common market, but called on  officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six members to the next  summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993.      The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran  ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its  commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and  territorial integrity of the region's states.""      It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it shares with the  United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller islands, the Greater and  Lesser Tumbs.      It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified Iranian measures  which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on Iran to rescind  those measures and end the occupation which it said was ""shaking peace and stability in  the area.""      Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it  established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.      It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the  UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces continue to  exercise their authority over the whole island.      The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation.      The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the  Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general  settlement.   REUTER YA DYA DJG  RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS   (Eds: updates with SNSC statement)      NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on Saturday it was ready  to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its eight-year war with  Iraq.      ""Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to the world that  our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and safeguard the  territorial integrity of Iran,"" Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) said.      A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council voiced full support  on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf  islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb.      The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings. Besides the UAE, the GCC  also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.      Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's meeting on  Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University: ""Iran is surely  stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood.""      The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received in Cyprus, also  criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as ""irresponsible.""     ""No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,"" said the SNSC.      Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to be close to the  Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's self-restraint had certain  limits.      It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971 agreement to  share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied.      ""The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain from responding to  the blows inflicted by them was ""childish,"" Tehran Times said.      IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which urged Iran to  reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull out of the two other  islands.      Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have historically belonged to it.  The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.   REUTER AF JCH  RTw  12/28 1011  TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN      TEHRAN, Dec 28, Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers, angered by Gulf Arab claims to  three disputed islands, are hitting back with demands that Tehran revive its claim to  Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq.      President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials strongly condemned a statement  last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) backing the United Arab  Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands.      But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran go further than  restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb  and Lesser Tumb.      ""It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined the others,"" Jomhuri Eslami  said. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.      ""If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh of Bahrain should go about  his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, which belonged to Iran until  1970, should be re-established,"" the paper said.      ""It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of Iran's sovereignty  over Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the separation of Bahrain  from Iran,"" it added.      The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970, a year before the  island became an independent state.      Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully avoided raising the  Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during periods of  tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf.      Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of appeasing pro-Western  Gulf Arab rulers had backfired.      ""No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, it  is the United States and the West which speak the last word,"" it said.      ""They (the sheikhs) are nobody,"" Salam said, adding that Iran should revise its policy  towards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq.      ""Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with Iraq...and going along with  some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role in the formation of  the current situation,"" the paper said.      Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988, improved briefly  after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.      But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the ensuing war,  again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed a Shi'ite Moslem  revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait.

""There was no such thing as Palestinians"" ED> (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday  ED> Times, 15 June 1969)     And what do suggest that she meant by this?  Do you think she     meant that the Palestinians don't exist?  Or does it actually     mean that the people who self-identify as 'Palestinians,' did     not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of Golda     Meir?   ED> 2. ""There is, however, a difficulty from which the Zionist  ED> dares not avert his eyes, though he rarely likes to face it.  ED> Palestine proper has already its inhabitants."" ED> (Israel Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, London 1920,  ED> p.88)     When this was written, seventy three years ago, the people of     the region were not all Jews.  They are not all Jews now.  No     Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to     be ONLY for Jews.  That was true then.  It is true now.   ED> ""[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs."" ED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to  ED> the Knesset, ED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the ""Beasts"", New  ED> Statesman, 25 June 1982)     Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are' we cannot     know what Begin was talking about.       For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an      absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy     Research,' you are not a very honest person.  ED> ""Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians]  ED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out  ED> discreetly and circumspectly"". ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press,  ED> 1960, I., p.88)     Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he     has stated what is Israel's policy today?  Have you ever seen     Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone       actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually      believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non-     Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  But if you realize     that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis,     then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will      give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid.  ED> ""We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the  ED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment  ED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any  ED> employment in our own country"" ED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960,  ED> I, p.88)     Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  You do     so within the context of modern day Israel.       Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  How does this fact define the     United States today? ED> ""[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place""  ED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben  ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press,  ED> 1985, p. 89)     Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this?     This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became     a state.  It has no bearing on Israel.   ED> ""We must do everything to ensure they [the  ED> Palestinian refugees] never do return"" ED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in  ED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet,  ED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)     YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees.'  And by doing     so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion,     who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,     at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the       MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their     homes.  What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews     were at war.   ED> ""The country was mostly an empty desert, with only  ED> a few islands of Arab settlement"" ED> (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's  ED> Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson,  ED> 1970, p.249)     At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true,     especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a     few short decades.

ED> ""Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can  ED> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat"" ED> (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the  ED> LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily  ED> Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987     Again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had     been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time     of the Balfour Declaration, just a few short years back.  And     what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't     include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the      innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human      being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab. ED> ""The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab  ED> workers is a cancer in our body"" ED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13  ED> December 1974)     There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted      of people from OUTSIDE Israel.  It is a wise to be concerned.     A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation     for a country. ED> ""There can be only one national home in Palestine,  ED> and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership  ED> between Jews and Arabs"" ED> (Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist  ED> Federation of Great Britain, 1931, ED> in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922,  ED> Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135)     This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years     after this statement was made.  Obviously times change.  This     is NOT what Israel is about today.  I believe the peace talks     make this quote irrelevant. ED> ""There is not a single Jewish village in this country  ED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village"" ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...)     This is completely false. ED> ""Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000  ED> Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have  ED> been prepared"" ED> (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military  ED> intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980)     Expelled from where?  Israel?  The occupied territories?  New     Jersey?  Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as     to what on earth he was talking about.  Obviously not. ED> ""We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the  ED> rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization  ED> as opposed to barbarism."" ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p.  ED> 29)     Interesting notion.  Considering that this was written nearly     a century ago, it is quite visionary.

Begin is dead.  And it     should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,     it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it     captured them.  Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of     them. ED> ""During the last 100 years our people have been in a  ED> process of building up the country and the nation, of  ED> expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional  ED> settlements in order to expand the borders here.

And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at      all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all     of these misleading quotes.  They are so out of sync with the     reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look     like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them. ED> ""Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian  ED> Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue  ED> against their hatred ?

ED> (Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal  ED> Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists,  Collier Books, Macmillan, New York, 1971, p.154)     Interesting quote.  It's true that we should never lose sight     of the plight of these people.  We should also recognize that     this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and     violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with      the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues      to this day.     If your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do     so, truthseekers in this group would have a problem.  But you     are an easily recognized fanatic, whose stream of misleading,     partial, and out-of-context quotes are totally  unfettered by     the burden of truth.  "

"talk.politics.mideast",77234,"Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree. Any discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the sole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the case for Israel although it might get a little closer than, say, Islam. This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism. Jews have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in many Christian countries. If we take Russia as an example Jews were seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church and State stopped at the baptismal font. Officially anyway. If a Jew converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.) Peter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background. Can we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism and was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief and AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not. What is AntiSemitism then if not something racially based?

For example: Experts from an interview (in Greek) with Professor Spyros Vryonis (from NYC's National Herald, 3/12/93) [Thanks, Mr. G.B.]  ""Few people know of the problem I faced at UCLA when Professor Stanford   Shaw was due for promotion. I knew him to be Turkey's man; due to my   reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member   of the promotion committee. For that case, I sat down and read his entire   treatise ""History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey"". It took me   three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized    Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw   himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome    of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well, I went on leave     and managed to show 40% of Volume I, containing around 5000 sentences,    to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages       from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a   500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw's plagiarism.    The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting,   promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for    all this: upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University   structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for   permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President   of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me   permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily,   the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more    than 150 academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused   to attend.

You are required to speak    diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you    my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to     participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory.    What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference,    timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy.    After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us    to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the    right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe    havens' for the Bosnians...    Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and    religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say    that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims    were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression    instead of Serbian aggression. Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which  pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger within the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin to predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:    I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear    this is a big deal... so they will understand. and it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have  aided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo has forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such conditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a ""divide-and-conquer"" game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression)  to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe. One final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has said in Rome last week that ""In practice, the embargo had the opposite effect intended.  It made aggression certain."" All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed to this tragedy. Sincerely,"

The top standing members end up with cabinet posts.  This is purely a political power issue.  Check the ranking of Arab labor party members, as opposed to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees. Once again, if for arguments sake, all the Arab Israelis were to vote for Labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the power shift.

"talk.politics.mideast",77251,"Actually, just after the FIRST world war, many Muslims were killed by Serbs. Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929). Some Croats formed a resistance movement ""Ustashas"" (Insurgents) and were forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile, they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership of Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world war, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in  to run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats (""flowers of Croatian people"").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina therefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they joined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at  less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time. After WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968, it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current president of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to prevent the category ""Muslim"" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the next census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, since that time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat nationality. Sincerely, Josip"
"talk.politics.mideast",77252,"My recollection of History/Documentary books is slitely different. It is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany during WWII, while Serbs had sided with Russia.  As a result Serbs did take a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany had the upper hand. Even today, Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers. This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active intervention against Serbs. As for the Bosnian Moslems, I have not heard of any alliance with Germany or Russia in recent history.  Therefore, I am curious if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict with same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past history. Regards; Ramin Moshiri"

As an atheist, I do not believe there is a god, nor do I believe that there ever was one. So, those commandments have no meaning to me. Also, there are a lot of ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people, the idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keeping kosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a  Torah that was inspired by god, etc.  By being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity. For me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural identity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a  cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as any other people in the world to have their own State.

Additionally, the secessions were to be negotiated, which would probably have required international mediation; instead the secessions were illegal, unilateral, and acts of war against Yugoslavia and those who did not want to be ripped out of Yugoslavia by the secessions."

Friedman          The Village Voice, May 11, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 19 Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and read ""I Led Three Lives,"" Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga of penetrating the Communist Party for the FBI.  Philbrick had become an American folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting colleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films portraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  In Boston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, Communist Party member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert Philbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque. For Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his homosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s, the life of a double agent was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist menace. ""I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick,"" Bullock recently told federal investigators, ""and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the Communist Part.  In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBI a full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took of some Soviet military vehicles."" Bullock was hooked.  For the next two years, he worked as an unpaid informant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became a paid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activities are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent American history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco. Over a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876 individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes, including the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian Movement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP, Palestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans for Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who even spied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when he visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on anti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile, between 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a prominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with Bullock. Last month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as Bullock's home, confiscating computer files and boxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock's files contained the driver's license and vehicle registration information, in addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was allegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, told the FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base had been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  ""Based on the evidence,"" says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, ""I believe that Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them with confidential criminal and DMV information."" What's more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for tapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false identities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from Bullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area trash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the Christic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message slips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers), office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the senders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic Institute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings, as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the dates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic Institute's checking account. Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed that the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with Israeli government officials.  What's more, Israel apparently used tips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there. The ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and later other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights movement. But there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on leftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung sharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a bastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite who heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger to Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists, blacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in America, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his ideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL's vast network of informants, who were given code names like ""Scumbag,"" ""Ironside,"" and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta"

"talk.politics.mideast",77268,"I don't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you  refer. Is this an explicit statement by some document? Or is it your  interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment  of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In  any case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts: Source: Walker, Christopher: ""Armenia: The Survival of a Nation.""         New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980. This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust:  a) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the  architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected  of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic  in Berlin during World War II;  b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social  theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members  of the Aryan 'Super-Race;'  c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves  with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and,  d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side  by side with the Wehrmacht. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast  network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents.  Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in  Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and  fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula.  They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in  an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of  this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1,  1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians  were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed  pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the  architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds  between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious  Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged  by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore"" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army. Serdar Argic                            'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents  and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian  asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians         'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1] At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim population of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly:'  ""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall   see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations  and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to  the race after becoming a nation.

In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order  ""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the   spirit of the Nazi ideas."" He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2] [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any  official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]  A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August  1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs. [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113. Need I go on?

As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills. The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...  Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire. We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts. Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  ""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission. Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary. The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have  signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians. We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed. Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot. What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

In fact, totalitarianism is etymologically a reasonable translation Islam. To be fair, the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of Muslims to join the SS.  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size.  There were also Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt of Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause actively.

For example, did US and other European countries abandon their moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops to Bombay when Hindus, in a rare fit of impassioned rage, killed many Muslims recently.

Because Mladic refuses to allow international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers in places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we have an accurate account of the number killed.

See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls ""the people"" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals call all the Bosnian Muslims ""Turks"" even though they are not ethnically Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason, what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically identical but religiously ""other"" is called, paradoxically, ""ethnic cleansing"" rather than ""religious cleansing.""

"talk.politics.mideast",77295,"Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition. In Bosnia, ""Muslim"" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic one as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject: (1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims     are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith. (2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel     themselves to be Croats nor Serbs. In 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid, and (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity.  So, arguments like ""yes, but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs"" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what their ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group, that ends the debate. What outsiders say is simply not relevant. In the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when ""Muslim nationality"" appeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing ""Bosniaks"" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H) declaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement  of this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of ""Muslim nationality"" choice in census forms. For comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Serb-Muslims:                        71,991 Croat-Muslims:                       25,295 Muslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403 This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have consistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose ""undeclared"", in 1953 they chose ""Yugoslavs"", in 1961 both ""Yugoslavs"" and ""Bosniak  ethnic group"", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose ""Muslim nationality"". Perhaps the term ""Bosnian Muslim nationality"" is too confusing for the rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking about Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some separate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and cultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general, because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political fanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival dominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact, Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime. Sincerely,"

"talk.politics.mideast",77298,"The annihilation of Islam (""Turks"") is an older Serbian agenda.   But I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda, in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is  anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong. To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply they are not separate peoples.  The events of the past two years clearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliance with Croats, they maintained this separation.  Croats would have accepted a much closer relationship, I think.  This century plus of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at risk, because of the inexorable logic of war.   Since Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavy weapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined, they have squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory. Muslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on). Under these conditions, any alliance is bound to fall apart since it is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs. The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the arms embargo.  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading the Europeans to go along with this, this hope was dashed.  Having no prospect of outside help, the former allies turned on each other, like two starved animals in a tight cage. This inexorable logic, of course, got plenty of help from Serbian intelligence operatives, who were doing everything to build mistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year.  A timely intervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this. Sadly, nothing was done to create a balance of power on the ground.  As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage, they can  break any alliance, even among friends.  This is tragic, but hardly new: ""divide et impera"" was used by ancient Romans with success.  In my view, Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9, 1993, when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost.   I have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do they believe Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder?  I'd like to know what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which solidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expect to prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces;  and how on Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice? The implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict, but I am filled with foreboding... Sincerely, Josip"

"talk.politics.mideast",77309,"May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly ""carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers.""  A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said ""the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,"" the  Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported.  But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment.  ""This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes,"" the statement reads.  The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.  The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to  carry out diversions against Azeri troops.  However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh.  Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes.  Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the  Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war.  The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities.  It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request  to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.

Derounian says that ""Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion  Armenienne.'""[2] That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the Nazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be included.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.

While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the Second World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's defeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces, hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim  population would be exterminated.

"talk.politics.mideast",77314,"I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been  born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land,  yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself  a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature, not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying with the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by  Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat:  ""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so.  They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when  people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and  where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.""[1] ""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel). ""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.""[2] ""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3] ""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey, however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection."" ""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition  to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this  sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of  priests.""

In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly   by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and   other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European   consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands   of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far   west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and   the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south   as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These   invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians   by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian   financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of   the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian   massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting   in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops   and homes.   Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of   Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt   and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases   with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose   Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the   rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of   instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread   their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where   their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes   such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled   them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with   little question or opposition.   On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British   High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David   and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:     ''Sir,       I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which       has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which       contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,       especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.       Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,       Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison       the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article,       he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course       this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40]   Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent   Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence   or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then   failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated   or led them.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars.

Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of     400 men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State     of Israel, compared to the deafening silence over the abusive     treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past 50 years.     Compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to Muslims who     randomly murder Jewish civilians to the righteous indignation     expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from     working in Israel in an effort to reduce these random murders     from occuring, while everyone knows that no country is at all     required to accept foreign workers, except Israel, of course.     Jewish blood has always been cheap.  The non-Jewish world ha     never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important, except     when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding     the high moral ground, as it had been just after World War 2.       However, as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of      themselves, the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again.       I doubt if the non-Jewish world is even capable of having any     compassion towards Jews as anti-semitism is so ancient and so     basic to both Christianity and Islam.       Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love     their own children more than they hate the Jews.  And while I     know that there are more Arab parents who love their children      than those who would send their children out into the streets      to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns,     the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend      themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of      those parents who not simply allow their children to do this,      but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way.  Even      Arab children are expendable, if their tragic deaths are used      in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel, and the       Jews, for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east.    Who is a Jew?  A person whose integrity decays when unmoved by    the knowledge of wrong done to other people.  -  A. J. Heschel"
"talk.politics.mideast",77328,"This does not change the *fact* that ""Muslim"" is a legal and political term defined constitutionally in former Yugoslavia, and therefore has meaning and consequences entirely *independent* and *immaterial* of any religious considerations. You only wish it were so. More than 2,000,000 residents of Croatia and B-H have *not* accepted the terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon them.  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H. Oh, BTW, *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was  destroyed by Tudjman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and the international community led by Germany.  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed against its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders can be changed as well.   As I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end when the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are finally agreed upon.

"talk.politics.mideast",77329,"   I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany *also* chose    a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of    other countries in peril. I wonder whether US or other countries    would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and    Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history    and I am just asking questions.) I don't think they would have.  After all the U.S. was one of the countries that turned away Jewish refugees when there was still time to get them out.  (Considered and rejected at the Cabinet level then..)    Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries,    is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious    accusations of religious bigotry and such. As I understand it, International law provides the right of any country to intervene to prevent genocide.  I think once the World Court has ruled that genocide is being committed...  If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N., we could have international monitors recording events and responses of local officials and develop an objective basis.  This could be backed by adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement through a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's command.  I would like to see the U.N.  directly impose ICJ rulings whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security Council.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court ruling).  The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the third world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran and Pakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!).   The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force initially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the Security Council).  The UN SC is quite a flawed body.  Rogue governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last few months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under Chapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force without requiring further SC action.  (The PRC even continues to threaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling.  The current set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..). Peace, Gul Agha"

"talk.politics.mideast",77331,"It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting, as much as HOW they have been voting.  Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections. Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas. Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff. I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates. Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored! Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest. And to answer your question, I ""broke"" with labor because I felt that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox coalition members. Fair enough.  My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument. If he was sitting on the committee, then someone else obviously would not be.  In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf. As to the proof presented in this article, I would find it very interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup describing how the matter stands/was resolved. Let me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions and groundless justifications. For the record, Roni Milo, is a brash MK (self described) from the Likud (note NOT LABOR).  Quite frankly, I don't think anything he would say could surprise me.  Annoy and aggravate, yes, surprise - no. Yes I do and thank you for providing it.

However, some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a   reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and   are racists. For this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out   against what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the   anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do   *not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all   Jews.

"talk.politics.mideast",77343,"ERGINEL) asked: [EE] No, no flaming here. Just a simple question. ...with a simple answer! [EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox [EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is [EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism [EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period.  The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian Apostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians  in Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.   [EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia [EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives. This is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in certain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact, Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all Armenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger  society. [EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what [EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian [EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion [EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak [EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the [EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian  [EE] consciousness. The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless of the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later  stages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to  Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This  practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy  of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these converted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems.  [EE] Any information will be appreciated. You answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry was the word Armenian! [EE] Regards,"

"talk.politics.mideast",77348,"Oboy, this is exciting. First you discuss your non-existent literature tastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism. Are you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements?  It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy. The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.  The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region. The longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court. Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled   'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.' The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.  HELSINKI WATCH: ""PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE"" Ankara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the ""Helsinki Watch""  it is stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end. The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the ""Turkish Minority"" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'. NEWSPOT, May 1992 GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey. Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is called ""Greek""  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with the Greek  newspaper ""Ethnos"" he said:  ""I am a Greek  citizen of Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish."" Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace. Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority, Faikoglu said.  ""In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights."" On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece. NEWSPOT, January 1993 MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE. Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.   Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.   Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  ""ENA""  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.   Bulev said in the interview: ""I am not Greek, I am Macedonian."" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that ""Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.""   The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  ""they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).""   The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.   In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.   Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.   Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.   Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.                 M. I. L.

"talk.politics.mideast",77351,"There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians. The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina' or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument. The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).  1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'.  6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.  7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'. According to Karakashian: As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians, this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.   Saint Martin: The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Ermeniyye. Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap' which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror,  while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and  therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'. G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary ""Haik"" is the diminutive form of ""Hai"", and that ""Hai"" is the name of our nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word ""Armen"" that foreigners apply to our people.' It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is  the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way connected with the word 'Hai'. Haik and Haiastan: Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and, in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Khoren. Haiasa: The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the  region known as Armenia. Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper Armenia.' Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'. Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with  no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it. The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'. Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and 'Haiastan' entered our older works. According to Karakashian:  'The word ""Haik"" is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it ever found employed in the forms ""Haika"" or ""Haykazn"". Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from ""Hai"" or ""Haik"" they could  also have used the words ""Haikak"" and ""Haykazn"" in a number of places.' According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite  inscriptions: 'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality or species. The words ""Haddanas"", ""Haddina"" were used by the  Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the ""d"" between the two ""a"" letters to ""y"" ""Hadinasdani"" was in this way transformed to ""Haiastan""'. Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai' and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a  solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa'  which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards. Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'. E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological  and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people. The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark, above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples. According to J. Deniker: From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are  descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region. They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of  85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic family. Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows: The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols, but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth.  Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a  distinct race. Serdar Argic                            'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                   (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                            'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                              a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)"
"talk.politics.mideast",77352,"A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia,  and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag  is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with  no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides  the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and  the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which  renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or  her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event  could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case  to occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis,  or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?                 An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated. The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded. Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.  One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan. It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR. We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade. But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands. The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent. But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes? All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins. 		THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                  KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                  OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR ""PAINFUL SEARCH .."" THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead. The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead."" Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians. Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours."" Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said. Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February. ""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot. ""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return."" There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces. THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92 HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope. ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive."" Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh. ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,"" Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother. ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We have never got any of the bodies back."" The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said. Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee. ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock."" Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

"talk.politics.mideast",77355,"They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait, a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties to Saudi citizens.  And me thinks if the US had not helped out the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at  least the eastern oilfields).  And no Muslim country was doing much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi Arabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating in favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims), just because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West. So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled back the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia??? I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an official religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature like it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the ones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this world (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a  leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator. You make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???) Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively enough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the government was not conservative enough, they have: 	- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom 	  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law 	  brings the death penalty.   	  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess? 	- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who 	  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on 	  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this, 	  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should 	  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as 	  prostitutes. 	  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've 	  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving 	  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc. 	  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want 	  these women falsely called prostitutes?   	  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely, 	  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind 	  anyone who hates anyone you hate. 	- say that women should not be allowed to work. 	- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom. Now, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government on earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among other things.  I just think that the most likely replacements for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country. But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing by the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women not fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it sends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that they've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious gatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who dare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of the wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition. As unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of Saud, like they're trying to in the long run. Is this really what you (and Rached and others in the general west-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd) want, Ilyess?"

"talk.politics.mideast",77357,"I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it (Will Durant ?), but I am beginning to believe the opposite is true. Here in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history is mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. In the history of my own people there are ample acts of shame, both done by my people and done to my people. Since I was not party to any of those acts, I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my ancestors committed, nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors. Will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque? Will it rebuild the Temple? Somehow I doubt that it will. A post in another group, on the Bosnian war, asked us all to love each other, that love would conquer hate. Sadly, I remember a TV interview with a young woman in Sarajevo (sp?) who was as I remember, a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. She was now trying to pick-off Serbian snipers. During the communist years she had married a Serb, who was now fighting against her people. So it seems that hate will conquer love. Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try and see how we might all live together?

"talk.politics.mideast",77359,"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Rabin and his Palestinians kapos Rabin's plans for a Palestinian police (from The Other Front, Alternative Information Center, Jerusalem, 5 May 1993) ""The decision to view the setting up of a local police force  for (sic) the Palestinians as the central issue for  deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week -  even before subjects like elections in the territories and  areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a  sign of the Israeli government's serious attitude towards  the peace process. ""The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture  package', but deals with the very heart and substance of  the Palestinian struggle for national identity. As it turns  out, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the  setting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently  also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to  ensure the holding of democratic elections in the  territories."" Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily  Hadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the  thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this  issue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the  settlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the  decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian  police force as a significant step towards the instituting of  real autonomy, something which will restrict what can be  done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street  theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian  police force', rightwing elements are attempting to  frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go  back on his decision. Members of the Kach movement  have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the  Occupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future  Palestinian police force. However, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the  new police force - as far as the Israeli government is  concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over  whom they will apparently have no authority, but will  control political groups within the Palestinian population,  whom the government is interested in neutralizing.  Writes Barzilai: ""...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting  up of a local police force in the territories will precede,  not only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of  the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement. ""The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a  local Palestinian police force is evidence that the  government is serious about arriving at a settlement with  the Palestinians..."" It's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly  worried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is  inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal  Husseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a  variety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would  like to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the  Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his  plans."
"talk.politics.mideast",77360,"REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA LORD OWEN AND THE SERBS In early February '93, Lord Owen made appearances in New York City on the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions on those shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he made the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying that since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to reconquer them today. I was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew who escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found sympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent months when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my father would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi and pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is so pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My father also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, because, my father said, Anthony Lewis ""is always talking about the Muslims."" Update--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around Sbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton administration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the collapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune. Previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces began to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers went unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention to stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West and a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to halt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that Lord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly calls for strong action. CLINTON AND BOSNIA In the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department official, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made news when he resigned from the State Department because of the Bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian aggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there. Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration. Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has so far been the same. According to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect ""safe havens"" for the Muslims. At one point, Senate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from Congress, that he called for an investigation. Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled again and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what they want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been signalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish off the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would NOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this issue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could not have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better well before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed.. The Nation, the left and ""the Bosnian QUANDARY"" Typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the ""Bosnian quandary"" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes to do nothing, even while noticing ""the ghastly atrocities of the Bosnian Serbs""  and that the ""greater and lesser powers...dither and fuss [and] hang back."" (""Before anything else happens, the Clinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United States owes the"" U.N. the editorial concludes.) In its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that ""those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side of the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World War II.""  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the Bosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients including the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and others. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher Hitchens correctly called this editorial, ""contemptible."") William Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal columnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong Western and American intervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column (Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled ""International Cowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy."" He clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence. ""Having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent Croatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military aggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious ""ethnic cleansing"" which followed that, the United Nations now contemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since experienced.""  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged call for a ""more daunting and open-ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago."" Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his ""Watching Rights"" column in the The Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the ""aggressors""--the preferred term for the Serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than a year.  He explains that ""there is no  military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above all, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are not city people. ""It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of Bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price--that explains the conduct of the siege of Sarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation. ""Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule, made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The destruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan."" The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist, fundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban, cosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking the rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained by the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state. Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to secularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the Serbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic idea. Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for Clinton's presidency ""depend...on his acting effectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess.""  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely a betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us by proxy, just as Hitler was. One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a different form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for Europe.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians; that is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in Europe for decades to come. One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to the destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a whirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom. And as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we do so decisively, quickly and on our terms. Sincerely, Ronald Bleier"

You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920,  the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide,  tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against  the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and  deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

"talk.politics.mideast",77365,"No wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. Following the Greek  Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek  army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international  agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten  people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose  grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is 'Karabag'. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek  Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will  remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever  the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece  was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.              THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum. AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed... The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism. Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event. ""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted. When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered. In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying ""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded. We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik. There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter. After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport. All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me."" ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days. We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights. In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner. In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head. This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

If somebody wishes to counter the reality she described, fine.  [PTS] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [PTS]  [PTS]  [PTS]       The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective [PTS]       -------------------------------------------------------- [PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade [PTS]  [PTS]  [AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh [AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western [AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established [AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have [AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me [AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the [AR] origins of the conflict. During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject, a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri. The following should be interesting.  [AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually, [AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian [AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988, [AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move, [AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait [AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990. This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September 1991, page 28, we read:  ""By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in   Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party   for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to   reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were   deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000    Armenian inhabitants fled the city...""   Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in   Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away."" In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian  pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988! [AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule [AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of ""divide and [AR] rule.""  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [AR] history of the conflict. It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions. [AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in [AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an [AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in [AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian [AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran. Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno- Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict. [AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri [AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and [AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the [AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly [AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly [AR] nationalistic National Independence Party. It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the  Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and play dead.  [AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country [AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the [AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish [AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government [AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and [AR] possessions? The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive Armenians of ""lands, homes, and possessions"". [AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West. [AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian [AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible, [AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus. True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach! [AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea. [AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western [AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security [AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led [AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed [AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the [AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct. [AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces. Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of  Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia! Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would have us believe. [AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an [AR]""Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.""  The truth is that the Armenians [AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century. Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim.  Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as ""Artsakh"", which  comes from the Urartian term ""Urtekhe-Urtekhini"". NO Azeris yet!  Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as ""Orkhistena"". NO Azeris yet! In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet! From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom of Ervan. NO Azeris yet! Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or  Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387  A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the  Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet! By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet! Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen ""To Armenia"". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet! In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area was stated as 11,000. It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh! In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some  Muslims in Karabakh! In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188 priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh -- assuming no Kurds! Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:  ""The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the   proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings   to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between   Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and   Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis   Republic.   Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet   Armenia and Azerbaidzan! 				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan 							N. Narimanov 				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs 							Guseinov"" [AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their [AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian [AR] rule.  No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule in the Caucasus, including Karabakh! [AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew [AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How [AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in [AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and [AR] demanded separation from California? Non-sequitur.  [AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement [AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct. Armenian historians don't say this! [AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the [AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and [AR] nothing in common with Armenians. Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an  argument totally invalid! [AR] Azeris would have a better claim to [AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited, [AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation. Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo- political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity, Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan. [AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the [AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the [AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual [AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This [AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the [AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory [AR] nations, not just by Turkey. Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of Armenians. [AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the [AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the [AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the [AR] U.N. definition of 1974. Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local population!  [AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should [AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as [AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the [AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can [AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri [AR] conflict from growing and spreading. Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are  actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as an act of Allied aggression!

"talk.politics.mideast",77368,"Here is a press release from the White House.  Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100    WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letter President Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:   TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:        I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the   last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the   national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in   Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters   relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.   This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the   International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),   and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development   Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report   covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated   November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.        1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian   Transactions Regulations (""ITRs""), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the   Iranian Assets Control Regulations (""IACRs""), 31 CFR Part 535,   since the last report.        2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (""FAC"") of the   Department of the Treasury continues to process applications   for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously   reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a   substantial decrease in the number of applications received   relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.        During the reporting period, the Customs Service has   continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin   merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import   prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-   gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions   and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional   forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.        3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the   ""Tribunal""), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers   Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims   before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered   12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have   been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were   awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of   settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions   adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions   dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing   claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,   3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of   Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful   American claimants from the Security Account held by the   NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.        As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen   below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has   periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers   Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by   the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account   is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the   proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the   United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-   case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the   account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.   The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest   Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of   March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was   $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account   was $8,638,133.15.        4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the   arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.   Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.   More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been   disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary   withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger   claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their   complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable   awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were   awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October   1992.        5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling   the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the   Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (""FCSC"") has continued its   review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in   1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The   FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining   claims in early 1994.        6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,   the Department of State continues to present United States   Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the   United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.   In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of   supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim   against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign   Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United   States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in  several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also   filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure   of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation   violated the Algiers Accords.        7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of   the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No   successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will   take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up   his duties.        8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve   important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the   United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior   presents challenges to the national security and foreign   policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to   Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role   in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling   the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.   Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613   continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-   national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal   to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the   Congress on significant developments.                          WILLIAM J. CLINTON   THE WHITE HOUSE,       May 14, 1993.  -30-"
"talk.politics.mideast",77369,"Your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most '*ians'. Sarkis Atamian  explains in his book called 'The Armenian Community, New York 1955,  Philosophical Library' that, according to historians, original fatherland  of the Armenians was in Thessaly, Greece. Armenian invaders burned and  sacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population  and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian  civilization. All reliable western historians describe how Armenians  ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly  people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of  the Muslim people between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that  Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II  and that, even today, criminal members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism  Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism  among peoples.  Who says 'Arromdians' are no damn good? During World War II Armenians  were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over  the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik,  carried statements as follows:[1] ""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.""  Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.  ""We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities   against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the    murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian    neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish    and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant themselves government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.""   Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California. [1] James G. Mandalian, 'Dro, Drastamat Kanayan,' in the 'Armenian     Review,' a Quarterly by the Hairenik Association, Inc., Summer:     June 1957, Vol. X, No. 2-38. And stick around...

"talk.politics.mideast",77370,"You don't get it - do you? During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet  Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the  Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people,  but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants.  To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia.  In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish  homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet  Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways: 1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility. 2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide. 3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests. 4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian. Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue. Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide. With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand: 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide; 4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure; 5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands; 6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

Crown Publishers,  Inc., New York (1952).  (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5   million Muslim people) p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).  'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'  'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'  'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'  ""We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....  'I don't believe you,"" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The    man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse.    I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and    went inside.  The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an   iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black   with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As   the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face   up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what   was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,   as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so   I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his    slashed genitals."" p. 363 (first paragraph).   'How many people lived there?'  'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.  'Did you see any Turk officers?'  'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'  ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -   Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled  so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into   laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense  of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.  From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last   scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,   looms, even spinning-wheels.  'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must   leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And   for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.   Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in   a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'"" p. 354. ""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole  high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,  but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust  of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on  Moslem villages."" p. 358. ""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three  sides. ""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. ""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror."" ""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked. ""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not."" ""But the women and children?"" ""Will fly with the others as best they may."" p. 360. ""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'  Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.  As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.  Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.  'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.  At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-  arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."" p. 361 (fourth paragraph). ""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,   large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble   where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet   had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.  The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.   There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was   empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking   colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead."" p. 358.  ""...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled   north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands,    Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -   coming in from Transcaucasus.

Of course, for this to happen we can't believe that the best path to  *making ourselves feel better* is at the expense of others. As long as  those valuing the coming together of ""opposing"" parties do not pursue  their vision with the same passion as do those polarization specialists,  we will stay stuck in the circus of one-upsmanship we now have.

The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the     intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in     this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel,      and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a     great steaming heap of hatred!     You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for     objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from      their original context so that they can be used to further an      agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel.     You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image      of several Israeli leaders.  I can't say if you actually HATE     these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do     suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.     So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an     ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is      false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident     that you hate the Jewish people.     And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can     be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish     background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there     is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade     away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage     for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that      you hate the Jewish people.     And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your     own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me      that you hate yourself.     ""Who is a Jew?

I hope you can come up with a definition in itself and not something like: look at this person, that is a self-hating Jew.

"talk.politics.mideast",77376,"Providing safety and security for one's own people is the most fundamental responsibility of any political entity. For the Palestinian leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the responsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elements who are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. To argue that a Palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful political groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical Palestinian elements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by Palestinians. This is a problem that can only be solved by the Palestinian people."
"talk.politics.mideast",77377,"All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not to ""Liberate Kuwait"", The people who were killed by the invasion are more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how  your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to be surprised not to know). It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over 200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement. Human rights in Kuwait? what about human rights in Iraq? why the west gave Saddam a green light to slaughter his own people? I will give my reason: because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves, so they deserve some democracy, but Iraqis might not, so they don't. As simple as that, whether or not you want to admit it. Not necessarily the best solution, my view of an Islamic state (and that of Turabi that your media made you hate) includes all the benefits of a secular state minus the injustices. Did you ever read a book by Rashid Al-Ghannoushi (Tunisia), Hassan Turabi (Sudan)? You only know about them from your Self-censured, self-controlled media. If they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as Turabi is, and keep quite about such an extremist Muslim scholar as Bin Bez of Saudi Arabia is, it just does not encourage any moderation in our ARab world. No it was not that, it was just some irrelevent stuff that I took out to go around the copyright (;-)) I ceased to take the Newyork times seriously. In issues concerning Islam it has become one of the biggest enemies (although less than the other NewYork daily since Mortimer took it over). It lies, selects facts that fits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti-Muslim editorials. What they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while  the selected facts are true about some of those persons, the other members are actually defence lawyers and University science professors who wanted to fight corruption, uncover atrocities against opposition activists and Shia minority, and generally increase awareness about the rights of all  citizens. The only thing that is common between those people is their concern for the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green light from AMerica (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay in power.  Do you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things? the ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are opposing it. SOme of the members of the human rights committe are MORE PRO-WOMEN and wanted to defend them, and that is precisely one reason that Bin Bez's Fatwah  implied for the ""Illegality "" of this committee and  for his claim that it represents ""Outside interests"" There is a human rights issue in Saudi ARabia, and YOU and NY times chose to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee and actually defend the actions done against them (including banning them from their Jobs. What a hypocricy. I am not surprised really, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. The official Ulema are the most extremist anti-women meat-heads in Saudi Arabia, the west continues on its campaign to discredit itself in the Muslim community, by supporting them. Well after Bosnia, I guess it has ZERO credibility to begin with, so what the heck. ""Idha Lam tastahi Faf'aal Ma shi'it"" (If you feel no shame, then do whatever  you want, Hadith).

"talk.politics.mideast",77378,"Try coming up with your own definition of any or all ""self-hating"" peoples. To me, any who reject their culture to the point where they *only* see the absolute negatives of that culture (generally, or regarding a particular event) and accept *only* those views purely opposing aspects of that culture  (thus, selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring of ""context"" results) ""hate"" their culture. That certainly describes Elias,  since he has no intention of recognizing that, alongside the Palestinian experience and perspective, there exists also that of Israelis.  And, this is precisely why Israeli society has been tremendously harmed by the actions it (its government) has *felt it had to take* in response to an ""other"" perceived as a threat. Just as with you, there has long  been a strident and emotional debate about the pain Israelis feel when  forced to ""balance"" desires for survival and moral beliefs. The trauma of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither can be conveniently brushed aside (as a result of a reasoned political debate) for the sake of the other, only reshaped. "
"talk.politics.mideast",77379,"I believe that things are getting mixed here. Critizicing Israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing ""the absolute  negatives of that culture"". Maybe, because a person can see the positives  of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the State of Israel. I, for one, consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to the human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty opposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of  respect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion, segregation and years in the diaspora. He might not want to recognize that. It does not make him a self-hating Jew, as far as I see it. At most, he is a person who is not telling the truth. But, so far, it seems that the blame is always put on ""the other"". If you read this newsgroup, for example, Israel is never guilty by herself. She is always responding to the actions of the ""other"", and it goes as if the actions of Isreal do not also affect the response of the ""other' in a cycle that never ends. Also, there is blindness to try to understand what the other feels and why. There is always and excuse. There is always a rationale to explain why things happen as they do. And, what is the worst part for me, there seems to be all the time an intention to try to de-humanize the ""other"", as if the other did not care about their future, children, peace, etc, etc. AAP"
"talk.politics.mideast",77380,"Is your stomach all right? Unable to digest your lunch? Cool down... In the context of Bosnia muslims are a nation. And nobody talked about them being a race.

Of course, you might want to apply again to Kossovo. 					 Bye, 					Yannis."
"talk.politics.mideast",77381,"You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the days of the Ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of difference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews... So, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the bosnian muslims were ""Turks"". After all, there aren't many ""real""  (ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today. Even in Europe, it's the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of one's culture. Can you support this? 						 Bye, 						Yannis."
"talk.politics.mideast",77382,"If that ""culture"" referred to is Israeli, being anti-zionist can be seen as a complete denial of that entity's right to exist and its ""legitimacy"".  Just as saying that Islam has *no right* to establish and implement a  ""state"" that includes any non-muslims, both are *absolute*, one-dimensional  views of that culture with regard to the issue of ""state"". If that were the case, one would expect a few of that culture's positives to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand. Since the issue *centers* on Israeli culture, I have yet to hear of *any* positives of that culture in this discussion. I agree with you. But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted  by another group that wishes to see that culture ""disassembled"", the first culture has little choice but to *try* to secure its ""survival"" as well as maintain its moral center. Since the culture is not about to turn away from *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral  principles, it has the virtually impossible job of ""balancing"".  To discuss Israel's faults and ""crimes"" without *any* recognition of this circumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the  discussant's political biases, NOT on an honest and empathetically open  understanding of the situation. The same applies to those who attempt to  paint the Palestinian movement as ""all bad"" and dispense with considerations  of the *reality* facing them. You beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue of ""self-hating"" addresses the motivations. I certainly feel that anyone who expends so much effort inflating, distorting and robbing human context from aspects of his/her own culture is reflecting a degree of dislike for it. Since bits of that culture are bound,  due to his/her upbringing, to be a part of him/her, a bit of self- dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere. As you well know, this process of *blaming the other* for the morally questionable actions one side is forced (by the ""other"", of course) to  take is thoroughly practiced by **both sides**. If you are only hearing the pro-Israeli crowd's self-supporting arguments, that may be due to the fact that you are not listening for anything else. *I* certainly hear the similarly distorting pro-Palestinian/pro-Arab element in *this* newsgroup (as well as in soc.culture.arabic). I agree, agree, agree, agree. However, in my response to the initial discussion above between Davidsson and those opposing his presentations, I saw Davidsson carefully putting  academic frills around a blatantly one-sided series of I-hate/dislike- ""them"", yesIdo,yesIdo,yesIdo. I did *not* find the approach of those  opposing Davidsson to be centered *at all* on a denigration and denial of the ""other side"".  I certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson's views on the  Middle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection of his jewish lineage. Having said this, however, I agree with you that  this constant accusing others of being ""self-hating"" jews seems pointless. It is not worse a label than is ""why, you're on their side"", except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic  biasedness. Tim"

"talk.politics.mideast",77384,"This is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were killed and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder, not some fictitious ""supression of rebellion.""  Even earlier, one can point to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of Muslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the Serbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum ""The Expulsion of the Arnauts"" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic on March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:    The Mode of Removal    [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed    through state terror and ""private initiative"", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]    Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should    distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik    action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]    ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,    if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be    incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the    Chetniks, rather than the army.    There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL    EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages    and city quarters. (Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually all Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism against Muslims, aided by Chetnik ""private initiative,"" has continued in WWII and today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book ""Od tradicije do  identiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana"" (Sarajevo: Svjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca in WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining their action as follows:    ""Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you    are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not    torture you."" so the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs have repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction of mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the eradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs. Which part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim. Croatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it was not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the end of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism came into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the best Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations  to Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian nationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As for your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.   In international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to counterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the end of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats and Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are unstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and Muslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.   You are wrong if you think only ""image"" is at stake here.  Croatia has a deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.   I think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice  at this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before  any open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will survive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse off.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not see it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left? If not, then all bets are off. Mr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt. This is not about some ""image"" but about survival of a concept of a partnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats and Muslims.   Sigh... Josip"

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander         of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,         Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov) ""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the  liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the  allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of  the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian  was permitted to approach the city and its environs.  While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained  in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the  area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to   attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the  plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder  of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by  the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers  who had remained in the rear during the war.  One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of  soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of  seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,  and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud  and dirt...  It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and  traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds  and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night  patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The   Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear  also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the  trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for  fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder  and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.  Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir  Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander  in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.  The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals  that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its  highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half  of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.  ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,  Odishelidge. They were as follows:  The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the  act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...  More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been  killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless   Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the  murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood   near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:  'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten  more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when  the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.  The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently  fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.  Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw  towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew  to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and  destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.  During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages  that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the   Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers  were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time  when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill  the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries  of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the   Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would  have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from  acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with  hatred and loathing.  Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that  he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The  Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the  stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since  the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed  in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen  of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping  him with the iron heel of his boot.  Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape  from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off  by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered  children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village  of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:  There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.  Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and  spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about  25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140   centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,  children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of  rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.  A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators  for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov  to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be   proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's  disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,  instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely  reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told  the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more  licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent  and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity  and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,  the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and  claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.  An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command  narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:  The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut  out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.  The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men   of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they  took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people  among this group were able to save their lives as the result of  my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were   released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.   Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the  Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered  on the streets.  On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent  Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were  threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for  murdering an innocent Turk.   When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would   be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare  you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the   Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard  that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within  the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same   day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to  him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible  act. However no result was achieved.  In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a  natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived  the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the   Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had  been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.   The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed  one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached  three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details  of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers  were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even  withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred  people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading  Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.  However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with  the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower  classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders  of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.   I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals  were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who  opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that  it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.  Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian  cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have  supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred  to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by  the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.  You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a  conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear  of the Turkish soldiers.  The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real  nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can  be undone.""

"talk.politics.mideast",77389,"Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,  the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated  in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the  hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of  innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia.  They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman  Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide  as acting with a    'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'  History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.  The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories. The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government. The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

"talk.politics.mideast",77390,"It is 'Serdar', 'kocaoglan'. Just say so.  The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992  Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war  Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in  the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from  Agdam  Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt  roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community ""sitting ducks, ready to get shot"". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  ""The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing."" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. ""Next they will drive us out or kill us all,"" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ""It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.""  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  ""The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,"" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. ""I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.""  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: "" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?"" wailed a mother. ""Raped. Butchered. Lost.""  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in ""crossfire"". Are you idiot for real?      'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'       (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W.

"talk.politics.mideast",77391,"The above explained propaganda which certainly has nothing to do with  the true facts is also today the main source of ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists' illegal activities that still try to make money out of the bodies of  the innocent victims of the Turkish genocide. The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General  Assembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1948, containing the  following provisions: The Contracting Parties, having considered the declaration made  by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution 95 (1) dated December 11, 1946, that genocide is a crime under international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world; Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity; and Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such odious scourge, international cooperation is required; Members agree as hereinafter provided: Article 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under  international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish. Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as  such: A) Killing member of the group; B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life     calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole     or in part; D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group; Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable: a) Genocide b) Conspiracy to commit genocide c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide d) Attempt to commit genocide. Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals. Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian  massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been  difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles to start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottoman citizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE), to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartus and Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE),  to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority and to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT GENOCIDE).

"talk.politics.mideast",77393,"Pardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative  mechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical  example of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism  which shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood  behind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles  were in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious  criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted  the Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the  19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the  existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to  the Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the  Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were  remnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians  attached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian  Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics  attached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a  Patriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a  Patriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian  Catholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13)  Nestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure  outlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman  Empire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2]  [1] N.

As a reference book, a dictionary contains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current use.  That's also why they are updated so often.  Now, if you are saying things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, and using non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance of being taken at face value...? Just about none.  Just about no one will take you that way because the words mean something different to them.  It's quite clear to me from the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is happening.  Ponder that. What you did was ask a leading question.  In English idiom, the phrase ""and guess why..."" in the way you used it is a loaded question, with only one answer expected.   I also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who is obviously having trouble with the subject himself.  Mr. Pinkas, I am a PhD candidate in my field.  One does not get to PhD candidacy if one cannot read.   Balderdash.  You know this is false.  I would be able to make the abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter. Yours did not.  The analogy is utterly inapplicable. I wouldn't be in the field I'm in -- astrophysics -- if I couldn't make abstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things.  I also wouldn't be in education -- which I am (and my students give me rather good reviews I'd add) -- if I couldn't draw such analogies. The vast majority of Palestinians in Israeli prisons aren't tortured, and their houses weren't blown up by the army.  In fact, you've seen me protesting such measures ON THIS NET before.  Are you now trying to intimate my agreement with them? Do you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the reader to read your mind?  I can read just fine thank you.  And I don't need someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which isn't his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native tongue.  If it were Spanish, I'd ask you.   Yes, they are.  As you well know. Balderdash.  See above.  Once again, you have a lot of gall and absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language, who is well educated in it, in a language which isn't your own native tongue and with which you're obviously having problems. Social life is one thing, legal status is another.  Once again, this is a leading question. Final question:  Is it possible to be both Jewish and Muslim?  Jewish and Christian?  Your response will be enlightening."

I lived in the west, and I have seen how    your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against  No doubt you plan on exploiting ""helpless naive Americans"" for your own purposes. Hmm...let's see:    Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that    led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to    be surprised not to know).    It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.    What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over    200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen    if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct    or indirect result of western envolvement.  Possibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on Greenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental consequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely* ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of over 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of work on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real number seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of Kuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've included an article I recently posted below, but this is really old news.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only a few months after the war, but it was hardly reported.  For the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to kill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait.  The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at Mutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out slaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points.   Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled on foot.  Furthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded is completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly)   that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*.  You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid, was his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the Kurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.    Yet, when it comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate, he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started.  What a joke!  APn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By NICK LUDINGTON   Associated Press Writer     WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was told that  as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put  the toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private.     But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the  Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public.  Now, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may have been  as low as 1,500.     That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the  quarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet from U.S.  defense sources.     The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of  vastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended. Claims  for a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down.     Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking  pictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued  unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War.     Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that  originally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Horner,  the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi  military death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war.     The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of  Iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in January and  February 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher reiterated  past statements that ""there just isn't a number,"" that is credible.     But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops  killed, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar  with the Pentagon's reports.     Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9  by American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies.     Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army's  reluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense  system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles.  The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the  Patriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent.     The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used  against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more  modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon.     The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a May 1991  report by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000  Iraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians  were also killed.     The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency  estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the air and  ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate  could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction.     But as more information became available, those figures gradually were  revised downward.     The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000  wounded after a review last year.     But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign Policy,  estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as  1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded.     Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found  and buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews. He noted  that only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded.     Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were  captured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative  ratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like Iraq, he  set battlefield deaths at 1,500.     ""Maybe the figures are too low,"" he wrote. ""Maybe the real death toll on the  battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence suggests a  death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000.""     In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base because it  would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of  operations were casualties.     He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology,  but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia. "

It is a unique association concerned with the civil,  political, economic, social and cultural rights of the  Palestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues  of concern are land confiscation, education, prison  conditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal  allocation of Israel's resources. Today there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living  within the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel),  constituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an  empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the  needs of the Jewish population. Legally and practically,  Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early  promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not  been fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly  affecting the Palestinian national minority. Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since  1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does  not receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to- day level, Palestinians face discrimination in many  different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission  to build a house, start a business, find a job or educate  their children.

Source: Pierre Oberling, ""The Road to Bellapais: The Turkish Cypriot         Exodus to Northern Cyprus"", Social Science Monographs, Boulder,         1982, ISBN 88033-000-7. Well, I am forced to disagree with you. The Greeks started massacring  the Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into  Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is  nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention  was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing  numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been  planned for a peaceful minority. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots  will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain  eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the  cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was  the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops  on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of  Archibishop Makarios. The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct. Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If  such assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason  to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate  their past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find  it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before,  for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical  vicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation of two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another  armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily  but decisively terminated by the Turks.  The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population  in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which  were established through international treaties. One might be better advised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve  Greece well. An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions  that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for  Greece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been  placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.

As ""Azerbaijan"" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In particular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in the most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the number of the priority manufactures will be released from debts.  Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil  companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations. THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN    Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis, the chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.   This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't be submitted for discussion.    Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for the Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the  objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the republic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament, ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion on these questions.    The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago, when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.    The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50 deputates (25 ""democrats"" and 25 ""partocrates""). At that time ""democrats"" and ""partocrates"" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long  time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time, the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out of the Parliament. --0-- THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA     Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign  Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18.  The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of Economics of Estonia.    The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku, the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the republic.--0-- AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE    Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS common economic zone.    Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a  common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic.  According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.    Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic zone.--0-- THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW      Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan.  According to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.     As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent,  precise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in Moscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.     When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end  of May.--0-- AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF MAY      Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia, Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.      ""Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by  insistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6"",- said Gasimov.      The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be  given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.      As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by Armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0-- THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN    BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers  condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent people is unjustified.     Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves, prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they served.     The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also  unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.    Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the Russian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0-- AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS      BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six accused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will be directed to Russian parliament.      According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the investigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation in the war against Azerbaijan. ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE ""KARABAKHS"" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS      BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of  Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies on the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the newspaper ""Russky vestnik"" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.      The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the  documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of ""reunion"" of the North Caucasus and ""Armenia proper"" at present, the front is appealing to  the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.      To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity ""identical to those in Nagorno Karabakh"". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus  instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.      Thus according to the newspaper ""Russky vestnik"", ""new Karabakhs"" are  being planning on the North Caucasus. --O-- STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT      BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of Azerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural centers was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president Elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and culture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered.       The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a legal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all  nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.      The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy, Hidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the ""undeclared war"" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many  problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic groups.       For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture  and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary).       As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of Azerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened,  radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the educational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.--O--  MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED      BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State  concern ""Azerineft"", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies ""AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum"", ""Bi-Pi Exploration Operating"", ""Pennzoil Caspian"", ""Unocal Khazar Ltd."", ""McDermott"" and Turkish oil corporation on mutual extracting of fields ""Azeri"", ""Chirag"" and ""Gyuneshli"" was signed.  According to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common program of activity was created.       According to the president of ""Azerineft"", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently.       During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the exploitation of these fields.  The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas fields. --O-- ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS      BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on  six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh, Armenian propaganda has become actively involved.      The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin with a request ""to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian soldiers"". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings on the case in Baku as ""a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia"".      The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could believe the Yerevan agency ""Snark"", the Armenians in Karabakh presented an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in Karabakh will be shot dead.      It is simple to explain such ""touching attitude of Armenians"" to the six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed it will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.      If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its saving of lives of ""innocent Russians"". --O-- NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA      BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan from the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.      The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from Kafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were destructions in the villages.      On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere, Shynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in progress.      At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of Armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated into the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two shepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a flock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O-- ""UNOCAL"" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN      BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the representation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of 50 houses for refugees.      At present, the American side suggested a village project for  consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary accommodations and so on.      According to the program the construction and putting into operation of the village will be this year. --O-- MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE      BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the national currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian Ruble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar. Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with  respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value 10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is the same at banks, state establishments and in trade.      According to the representatives of the business circles and experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles are bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial operations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics of the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen arrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business  with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much  Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O-- THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY     Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the expert group, including representatives of the Parliament and  presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before the Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new Constitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of the country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the press-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.     Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and  representatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev and Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.     The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary election law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill didn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative variant of the election law was put forward.    The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions will examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0-- ISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR  CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED    BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the Azerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with the conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant K. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan.    In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan Milly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme Soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal case. In his view, ""the conclusion of the commission could help in the  objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems in the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the knowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime"".    In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message, Milly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the permanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of this problem.--0-- WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?       Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative to the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the  Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with the representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case the peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.      Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors of the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from the peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial US departure from Transcaucasia.--0-- FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER    Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company, Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of oil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer. As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL- RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian fields.    According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete treaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and PENNZOIL will sign treaties.    Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645 million ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton on Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.    The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to bring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net economic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in the defence of its interests at the international scene.    As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement ""the May of 1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its independence and we have to stand these tests"".--0-- THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN    BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan informs, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the Russian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received. The appeal contains the call ""to display mercy, humanism and clemency  on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces"".    The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the participation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people, don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce the mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the Russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.     At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers' mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the president of Azerbaijan to ""save those guys"".    It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers, taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only Russian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down lives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made answerable.     Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers of Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0-- ARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS      BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of Azerbaijan were killed during the ""Grad"" shelling of the villages of Kolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of the republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.      The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of Tovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire from the territory of Armenia. There are destructions.       The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated.  On May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the village of Ortakend. The transportation of man power and military equipment to this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is setting up a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by villages.      According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentration of man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselsky district of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on the frontier with Fizuli district. --O-- AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN   BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations, Rauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that ""Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan after Iran"". The business cooperation between the two countries develops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil extraction equipment, communication and agriculture.   According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of Azerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May 23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will help, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch offices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on building in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the entire communication system of Azerbaijan.    In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain will have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.    According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great Britain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--              T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y                      Baku - Azerbaijan                       Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833                     Fax: (8922) 66-2009                    Telex: 142168 META SU Serdar Argic                            'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

"talk.politics.mideast",77812,"Funny you should mention. That's the whole point 'paliks' invariably miss.  Source: 'United Nations, Human Development Report,' 1990. Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity: Turkiye, Greece and Chile are in the same category. That is, $3,000 - $5,999.  Source: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R.         Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, Harper Collins Publishers,         1991, (second edition). In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to  Purchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with  Turkiye. Indeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The  economy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is  in outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name  of the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful  article in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty  linen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European  Community. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics, Greece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and at times even steals the European tax payers' money for political   featherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European Community.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that notwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European in mentality and attitude.  Indeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great  success with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy,  ready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged,  succeeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s. Just 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as  Turkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed  by far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are  concerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon. The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on  the infrastructure investments (rather than investing in world terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue  completely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question  to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West.  Nowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote  town, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance  call to any given country. However, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact, it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany round the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands, then your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of  Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece, by virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages of the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies.  Turkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports, has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which  enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus over the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be the only country in its region having permanent current accounts surplus.

"talk.politics.mideast",77815,"   I  must  finally  admit the total truth that is central to the core of my being.    I  am  a  homosexual.   Not  just  a  normal,  run-of-the-mill homosexual,  but  a  rabid homosexual Zionist.  I hide behind the facade  of  pro-Israel  rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my true  motive:  the exchange of romantic dialogue with Nick Steel, and  our  frequent  fudge-packing   adventures,  which   we  have endeavored  to maintain at a discreet level.  Of course, the need for discretion has been obviated by my own admission here.    The  truth  is  that  I  could  no longer hold this saccharine secret  any  longer.   I love  you,  Nick,  and  my  love for you surpasses  that  which  I  hold  for Eretz Yisrael, may she stand forever, as our love has, and as your erection insinuating itself into my kosher rectum always will.                                 =Mark="
"talk.politics.mideast",77816,"I caught the tail end of a piece on NPR (National Public Radio) about Chomsky.  Apparently there is a new documentary about him and his concepts on the propagandist news media of the West, or some such. The funny thing is that NPR painted Chomsky and the documentary in such a positive light, or at least ended the report in a positive way. The documentary is just now showing in a few cities in the US, and will open in more cities in June.  Sorry, forgot the title."
"talk.politics.mideast",77817,"Serdar, I have been told that you are not real, your account is fake (which I   confirmed by trying to E-mail you) and advised not to waste my time writing to   ""you"".  But, I get pleasure from watching you make a fool of yourself.  So you stand by the statement that all Armenians are barbarians.  OK, I see.    Lets not even act as if there is a chance they are human.  See Serdar, when you   judge people because of their race this is called racism.  I tend to frown on   this sort of thing.  Obviously you don't.  When you label an entire race the   way you do, it is easy to stop thinking of them as human beings, and this can   make GENOCIDE possible.  But I guess (and this is where Serdar will fill the   page with quotes taken out of context) you know that, huh? Don't you find it weak that all of Serdars enemies are   Fascist/NAZI/barbarian/_________fill in the blank with any catch all bad term. Public knowlege?  I was not aware of that.  NOW I see, the ARMENIANS decide to   kill the Israeli athletes in 1972 as PRACTICE.  I was confused, but thanks for   clearing that up. Wow, you are on a roll with the accusations today Serdar, so how did the   Armenians steal from the Turkish children?  Was it their lunch money?  This is   very cute how you inserted children in this fill in the blank accusation sheet   you fill out every day.  It really touches my heart.  Oh and thank you for   letting me know that Kurds and Armenians hate each other.  I was not aware of   this.  The only time I have ever talked about Kurds it was about the WONDERFUL   treatment they were recieving in Turkey.  They must have a high incedence of   insanity because there sure are a lot of them fighting against the   non-oppresive Turkish government that has let their culture flower over the   past 70 years. Thanks for the unbiased TURKISH MEDIA SOURCE.  I am sure the Milliyet is rated   number one for accuracy and truth. Innocent?  Is that what terrorists call their victims?  I have never heard of   terrorists calling their victims innocent.  ""Yes, folks in other news the IRA   public relations department reported that it had killed 20 innocent victims in   a car bombing...  ""  Nope Serdar, I don't think so. Oops you almost forgot to fill in the ""Say something about Turks being killed   by Armenians here"" section of your note. Yeah sure you are really Serdar Argic, and I am really BOB HOPE!!!!  So you may   have ALREADY won 10 MILLION DOLLARS!!!  Unfortunately for you the Armenian   Foundation in Istambul is SURE to steal it from you on the subway and then give   it to terrorists to kill innocent Kurds and innocent Israeli athletes.  Ahhh,   when are you going to take me to this fantasy world of yours??"
"talk.politics.mideast",77818,"Well everybody, After reading tons of notes by Serdar, I have come to the following conclusion.    Turkey is PERFECT, and no Turk has ever made a mistake.  He has proved to me at   least that the land occupied by Turkey today, was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by   Turks.  (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople)  They treat their minorities   like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked   them.  Somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder   their population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note,   Armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  I want to go   to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible, that   has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (Amnesty   International must have bad sources, Turkey would never torture its citizens,   treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who   incidentally are still missing), what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A   TURK!!!! Now back to reality.  I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to   ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia   of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE!  Anybody at   all who has believed ANYTHING he has said, please step forward.  Let him know   he hasn't been wasting his time, that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by   the volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. Well I am   off now.  I will go dream  some more about that perfect place, that nirvana,   that utopia, that xanadu, that TURKEY!   n_w$$h"

"talk.politics.mideast",77820,"Dirty Cosar pig has been doing just that for a long, long time. Source: ""Ahmet Cosar said to have been part of 1992 Terror Attack at MacDonalds in Munich,"" The Fuckersville Reporter, February 7, 1993, p. 1. ""Le Merde, the influential Anatolia daily, based on unidentified sources, claimed last week that Ahmet Cosar, the founder and leader of one faction of the Big Mac Funny Army for the Liberation of Flies from the Spider Webs (BMFALFSW), was among the Argic led terrorists who staged an attack on the toilets at MacDonalds fast food restaurant in Munich... Le Merde added that up to 1992, Cosar operated out of tygra.michigan.com, but escaped from the country when Bullshit bikers entered the city. It was about this time that a statement issued by BMFALFSW claimed that Mr. Cosar was dead of wounds suffered during a mailbombing by bdb@becker.gts.org, although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and well and presently is residing alternately in Fuckersville, Bullshitia, and Zuma, Stupidia. The paper also noted that the communist government of Sexual Maniac Hasan B. Mutlu and his F.U.C.K.A.L.L party accepted the Zumabot's underground leader with ""open arms"" and still providing him with assistance in exchange for pornographic material. Le Merde further adds that BMFALFSW derives only a small portion of its expenditures from wealthy drug lords who support the cause, with the rest  coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in child-porn trafficking.""

"talk.politics.mideast",77822,"Lovely arguments.  But do we write about historical ownership of any place - Palestine, Pakistan, Cyprus, Aegean Islands (and the oil that may lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other than justification for stomping others? DOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 years ago?  More than how you treat the land and each other? Who is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of birth?  Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm that birthed the people we wish to despise? IMHO, the American Indians have it right.  We belong to the earth, it does not belong to us.  Failure to understand that is a good way to cause lossage all the way around.  My guess is that once we trash our environment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating and killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk. Death and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins, disease vectors,  lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies, nor any other way.  When we fight over which national group owns which piece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point from which to kill others, ""our"" land and eventually ourselves. That is something of which to be proud.  Very proud.  Makes me glad to be human. I'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it's fair to ask whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that all _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it's an artificial distinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to contribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else?  [In history the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive hardest.  If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.] Then again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I, of course, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if I must shoot Muslim infants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do so.  That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the rightness of my cause. Clearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others because they are not like you.  I would never get in the way of such fun. Let's see:   	soc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to Lake 		Baikal where you came from, and leave the land to the 		Greeks, who stole it fair and square from the 		Scythians? 	soc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistribute 		yourselves over India, as God meant for you to do? 	soc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together, 		fight together, die together.  We are brothers, and 		inseparable. 	talk.politics.mideast - oh well, had to be there. Oded [Planning on being a Scythian irredentist, as soon as I finish my present assignment.] P.S.:	I can't get a semi-decent death threat anymore? P.P.S.:	Yeh, the Native Americans had it right.  We had to kill them 		off to keep their sedition from spreading."

"talk.politics.mideast",77850,"wrote in response to article <30975@galaxy.ucr.edu>, raffi@watnxt08.ucr.edu  (Raffi R Kojian) says: [IC] There are some Armenians here, in the USA. [IC] In fact, there are some areas where Armenians are majority. [IC] Suppose, a large group of people of one of such area decides, [IC] that the US ""government is not representing their interests, and vote for [IC] seperation"" from the USA. The Armenians you refer to have chosen to come to the United States lawfully  and peacefully. However, if Armenians invade the United States and force Americans to either flee or become Armenians, it will not succeed. Similarly, the Armenians of Karabakh are being forced by Azerbaijan to either become  Azeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated.  Karabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within the Stalin-prepared borders of Azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and  eventually was invaded in 1991 by Azeri OMON and Soviet forces, resulting in  the northern third of this Armenian area being depopulated of Armenians. The  Armenians have been fighting back ever since.  Clearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for Armenians, of let's say Glendale,  California, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent Glendale. Similarly, the Azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at claiming sovereignty over the land and people of Karabakh, who have lived continuously in Karabakh a thousand years before the first Central Asian  invaders ever stepped foot in the Caucasus.  [IC] Should they get it?  [IC] And should the UN enforce their will? [IC] And is it a simple, beautiful concept, indeed? Your analogy has broken down because you have switched positions of the victim and invader. A better analogy would be the direct parallel between Armenians  of Karabakh and Native Americans. Now, if you wish, we can discuss the tenets  of might versus right and the policies of settler nations!"
