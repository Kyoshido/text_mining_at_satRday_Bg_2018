# Text mining workshop at satRday Belgrade 2018

This repository stores materials for the **Text mining workshop** organized in conjunction with the [satRday Belgrade 2018](https://belgrade2018.satrdays.org) R event that took place in Belgade, Serbia, Oct 26-17, 2018. 

The stored R scripts provide an example for the text classification task. They present the overall workflow for the respective task, starting with text preprocessing and ending with examination and evaluation of the results. 
The example is based on the [20 Newsgroups dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/); hence, the csv files (in the data folder) are derived from this dataset (subsetted and pre-processed). 

Slides that introduce relevant concepts and methods are available at:

* [Bagging and Random Forest](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjwXFgNk6IQbgh5G-vQCyWnaXwZL)
